Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using a survey questionnaire from 1,302 managers working in eight Indian private sector organizations. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression analysis were used to test the hypothesized relationships between the study variables. Findings: The study found evidence of the mediating role of work engagement for the relationship between motivating job characteristics and managers’ turnover intentions. Conscientiousness moderated the relationship between work engagement and turnover intention. The total and indirect effects of motivating job characteristics on turnover intention were moderated by conscientiousness. Research limitations/implications: The study was cross-sectional, so inferences about causality are limited. Practical implications: The findings of this study reaffirm the crucial role of job characteristics in influencing work engagement and turnover intention. By examining work engagement as a mediator for the job characteristics-turnover intention relationship, this study explores the process through which job characteristics are associated with turnover intention. The findings of the moderating influence of contentiousness on the relationship of direct and indirect effects of job characteristics suggests that individual personality can influence social exchanges as well as managerial attitudes and behaviors in multiple ways. Originality/value: The study provides an insight into the underlying process through which job characteristics are related to managers’ turnover intentions.

The study further aimed to investigate the moderating role of D-A fit in the relationship between work role stressors and the above mentioned employee outcomes. The study was conducted using structured questionnaires for measuring the above mentioned variables. The sample of the study was 317professionals from five sectors. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyze the data. Hierarchical multiple regression results showed that the work role stressors were negatively related to job satisfaction and OCB and positively related to turnover intentions. D-A fit was seen to be positively related to job satisfaction and OCB and negatively related to turnover intentions. The analysis also found some support for the stress buffering effect of high D-A fit in the prediction of job satisfaction, OCB and turnover intentions. This study contributes to the organizational behavior literature by focusing on the fact that the negative effects of work role stressors on employee outcomes can be mitigated by identifying the variables which act as a buffer to weaken this effect. The results of the study provide support for the fact that matching employees to their job can help in the mitigation of employees' stress resulting in positive employee outcomes, hence benefiting the organization in the long run. © 2018 by IGI Global.

"", 'The effectiveness of mindfulness based programs in reducing stress experienced by nurses in adult hospital settings: a systematic review of quantitative evidence protocol REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to identify the effectiveness of mindfulness based programs in reducing stress experienced by nurses in adult hospitalized patient care settings.BACKGROUND: Nursing professionals face extraordinary stressors in the medical environment. Many of these stressors have always been inherent to the profession: long work hours, dealing with pain, loss and emotional suffering, caring for dying patients and providing support to families. Recently nurses have been experiencing increased stress related to other factors such as staffing shortages, increasingly complex patients, corporate financial constraints and the increased need for knowledge of ever-changing technology. Stress affects high-level cognitive functions, specifically attention and memory, and this increases the already high stakes for nurses. Nurses are required to cope with very difficult situations that require accurate, timely decisions that affect human lives on a daily basis.Lapses in attention increase the risk of serious consequences such as medication errors, failure to recognize life-threatening signs and symptoms, and other essential patient safety issues. Research has also shown that the stress inherent to health care occupations can lead to depression, reduced job satisfaction, psychological distress and disruptions to personal relationships. These outcomes of stress are factors that create scenarios for risk of patient harm.There are three main effects of stress on nurses: burnout, depression and lateral violence. Burnout has been defined as a syndrome of depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and a sense of low personal accomplishment, and the occurrence of burnout has been closely linked to perceived stress. Shimizu, Mizoue, Mishima and Nagata state that nurses experience considerable job stress which has been a major factor in the high rates of burnout that has been recorded among nurses. Zangaro and Soeken share this opinion and state that work related stress is largely contributing to the current nursing shortage. They report that work stress leads to a much higher turnover, especially during the first year after graduation, lowering retention rates in general.In a study conducted in Pennsylvania, researchers found that while 43% of the nurses who reported high levels of burnout indicated their intent to leave their current position, only 11% of nurses who were not burned out intended to leave in the following 12 months. In the same study patient-to-nurse ratios were significantly associated with emotional exhaustion and burnout. An increase of one patient per nurse assignment to a hospital\'s staffing level increased burnout by 23%.Depression can be defined as a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Wang found that high levels of work stress were associated with higher risk of mood and anxiety disorders. In Canada one out of every 10 nurses have shown depressive symptoms; compared to the average of 5.1% of the nurses\' counterparts who do not work in healthcare. High incidences of depression and depressive symptoms were also reported in studies among Chinese nurses (38%) and Taiwanese nurses (27.7%). In the Taiwanese study the occurrence of depression was significantly and positively correlated to job stress experienced by the nurses (p<0.001).In a multivariate logistic regression, Ohler, Kerr and Forbes also found that job stress was significantly correlated to depression in nurses. The researchers reported that nurses who experienced a higher degree of job stress were 80% more likely to have suffered a major depressive episode in the previous year. A further finding in this study revealed that 75% of the participants also suffered from at least one chronic disease revealing a strong association between depression and other major health issues.A stressful working environment, such as a hospital, could potentially lead to lateral violence among nurses. Lateral violence is a serious occupational health concern among nurses as evidenced by extensive research and literature available on the topic. The impact of lateral violence has been well studied and documented over the past three decades. Griffin and Clark state that lateral violence is a form of bullying grounded in the theoretical framework of the oppression theory. The bullying behaviors occur among members of an oppressed group as a result of feeling powerless and having a perceived lack of control in their workplace. Griffin identified the ten most common forms of lateral violence among nurses as ""non-verbal innuendo, verbal affront, undermining activities, withholding information, sabotage, infighting, scape-goating, backstabbing, failure to respect privacy, and broken confidences"". Nurse-to-nurse lateral violence leads to negative workplace relationships and disrupts team performance, creating an environment where poor patient outcomes, burnout and high staff turnover rates are prevalent.Work-related stressors have been indicated as a potential cause of lateral violence. According to the Effort Reward Imbalance model (ERI) developed by Siegrist, work stress develops when an imbalance exists between the effort individuals put into their jobs and the rewards they receive in return. The ERI model has been widely used in occupational health settings based on its predictive power for adverse health and well-being outcomes. The model claims that both high efforts with low rewards could lead to negative emotions in the exposed employees. Vegchel, van Jonge, de Bosma & Schaufeli state that, according to the ERI model, occupational rewards mostly consist of money, esteem and job security or career opportunities. A survey conducted by Reineck & Furino indicated that registered nurses had a very high regard for the intrinsic rewards of their profession but that they identified workplace relationships and stress issues as some of the most important contributors to their frustration and exhaustion. Hauge, Skogstad & Einarsen state that work-related stress further increases the potential for lateral violence as it creates a negative environment for both the target and the perpetrator.Mindfulness based programs have proven to be a promising intervention in reducing stress experienced by nurses. Mindfulness was originally defined by Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979 as ""paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally, to the unfolding of experience moment to moment"". The Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program is an educationally based program that focuses on training in the contemplative practice of mindfulness. It is an eight-week program where participants meet weekly for two-and-a-half hours and join a one-day long retreat for six hours. The program incorporates a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness and yoga to help increase mindfulness in participants. The practice is meant to facilitate relaxation in the body and calming of the mind by focusing on present-moment awareness. The program has proven to be effective in reducing stress, improving quality of life and increasing self-compassion in healthcare professionals.Researchers have demonstrated that mindfulness interventions can effectively reduce stress, anxiety and depression in both clinical and non-clinical populations. In a meta-analysis of seven studies conducted with healthy participants from the general public, the reviewers reported a significant reduction in stress when the treatment and control groups were compared. However, there have been limited studies to date that focused specifically on the effectiveness of mindfulness programs to reduce stress experienced by nurses.In addition to stress reduction, mindfulness based interventions can also enhance nurses\' capacity for focused attention and concentration by increasing present moment awareness. Mindfulness techniques can be applied in everyday situations as well as stressful situations. According to Kabat-Zinn, work-related stress influences people differently based on their viewpoint and their interpretation of the situation. He states that individuals need to be able to see the whole picture, have perspective on the connectivity of all things and not operate on automatic pilot to effectively cope with stress. The goal of mindfulness meditation is to empower individuals to respond to situations consciously rather than automatically.Prior to the commencement of this systematic review, the Cochrane Library and JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports were searched. No previous systematic reviews on the topic of reducing stress experienced by nurses through mindfulness programs were identified. Hence, the objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the best research evidence available pertaining to mindfulness-based programs and their effectiveness in reducing perceived stress among nurses.

Design/methodology/approach: Following a quantitative approach regarding methodological aspects of this research, a case study was carried out in a company of information technology and communication located in Porto Digital, in the Northeast of Brazil. A data collection technique with 172 forms, a self-administered form with 18 closed questions with a Likert-type scale and an open questionnaire were used. In this analysis, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software was used as the technique; besides the descriptive statistics, a correlation was made between dependent variables (intention of rotation) and independent variables (affective, normative, instrumental and work satisfaction). The level of organizational commitment in its three dimensions (affective, normative and instrumental), the job satisfaction in its five dimensions (satisfaction with nature of the task, with leadership, with colleagues, with salary and promotions) and the level of intent to turnover from the respondents were investigated. Findings: The results suggest that affective and normative commitments and satisfaction with pay, satisfaction with promotions and satisfaction with the nature of the work are correlated with the intention of negative turnover significantly. Among the demographic factors, only the age showed a negative correlation with intent to turnover. By performing multiple regression analysis, we identified that the variables that most impacted the turnover intention are affective commitment, satisfaction with salary and normative commitment. The qualitative portion of this study was accomplished through a content analysis of the open question of the form. Finally, one of the main considerations is the findings that revealed variables other than those adopted in the study, which influence the permanence of the respondents. Research limitations/implications: Among the limitations of the research a single case study is highlighted that replicates the experience in other ICT companies to verify if the results found are similar in other organizations and in other segments. The findings direct the construction and validation of new scales, the creation of qualitative protocols to identify the variables that influence the retention of a specific group of individuals to serve as a guide for the elaboration of a questionnaire, as well as creation of surveys of longitudinal nature to correlate the data of intention of rotation with the effective turnover. Practical implications: Based on the results, organizations can reduce voluntary evasion by adjusting actions, policies and practices, directing those responsible for People Management to attract and retain good employees. It should be emphasized that voluntary turnover should be treated as one of the management indicators of greater relevance by organizations, representing a thermometer of all human capital management. Social implications: The monitoring of employment and unemployment levels is part of the public policy agenda for generating employment and income in Brazil. For organizations, employee turnover can and should be managed and monitored so that appropriate levels are found and their consequences are minimized through effective solutions. The results are important both for technology-based organizations and for all stakeholders interested in the subject as the public power. Originality/value: Although in the international literature turnover is a topic of study for many years, in the Brazilian context, there is a shortage of research on the subject, specifically in the sector of advanced technology where there is a great lack of skilled labor, a fierce competition and where to keep employees standard high becomes a survival factor. This study may contribute to the exploration in the local literature, as it will help locate the academy on the Brazilian reality and open the doors to new research works on turnover and its possible correlations with other variables besides organizational commitment and job satisfaction. © 2018, Carolina Machado Dias Ramalho Luz, Sílvio Luiz de Paula and Lúcia Maria Barbosa de Oliveira. Job satisfaction; Organizational commitment; Turnover', ""The relationship between organizational commitment and turnover intention among employees at a manufacturing company in Malaysia Retaining employees is an important task to all organization. Therefore, turnover should be reduced as it caused high cost on the company. In order to reduce the turnover rate, the turnover intention of the employees should be known because it is the predictor of the actual turnover action. Organizational commitment is viewed as one of the important factors to retain employees in organization. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between organizational commitment and turnover intention among 127 employees in a manufacturing company in Malaysia. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20.0 was used to analyze the data. The findings show moderate level of employees' commitments and turnover intention. Meanwhile, the correlation between employees' organizational commitment and turnover intention is found to be negative and strong with significant relationship with r = -0.921. In short, an empirical investigation was conducted to study the relationship between employees' organizational commitment and turnover intention in a Malaysian manufacturing company. The results showed that there are negative as well as significant relationships between affective commitment, continuance commitment, normative commitment, and turnover intention. © 2016 International Information Institute.

The study also determined the effects of job satisfaction on organizational commitment and the impact of organizational commitment on turnover intention. Further the study examined the mediating effect of organizational commitment on the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intention. 150 doctors of Malaysian public hospitals were randomly selected as sample in this study. The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 18. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to answer the objectives and hypotheses of the study. The results hypothesized that job satisfaction components have a positive and significant relationship on organizational commitment. Meanwhile job satisfaction components were negatively related to turnover intention. The study revealed that job satisfaction components have a positive effect on organizational commitment and organizational commitment indicated a negative effect on turnover. The study also revealed that organizational commitment served as a mediator to the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intention.

Data were obtained from a sample of full-time frontline employees in Northern Cyprus hotels as its setting. The results of the path analysis showed that negative affectivity (NA) amplified employees' work-family conflict and family-work conflict. Work-family conflict was found to be a significant outcome of work overload, whereas family-work conflict was not. Neither work-family conflict nor family-work conflict significantly influenced creative performance. The results indicated that work-family conflict was significantly and negatively related to career satisfaction, whereas family-work conflict was not. In addition, conflict between family and work domains exacerbated turnover intentions. However, the results did not lend any support to the relationship between work-family conflict and turnover intentions. There was no empirical support for the impact of NA on work overload. The results demonstrated that career satisfaction had a significant negative impact on turnover intentions. The findings regarding the relationships among work overload, creative performance, and career satisfaction were in the hypothesized directions.

The results of the path analysis suggest that supervisor support alleviates frontline employees' conflicts in the work-family interface and increases their job satisfaction. Results demonstrate that family-work conflict influences job performance deleteriously. In contrast, the hypothesis that work-family conflict has a significant negative influence on job performance is not supported by the empirical data. The results of this study indicate that work-family conflict is a significant predictor of job satisfaction, while family-work conflict is not. In addition, the hypotheses that job performance exerts a significant positive effect on job satisfaction and job performance and job satisfaction depict significant positive associations with affective organizational commitment are supported by the empirical data. Although not hypothesized, results reveal that family-work conflict has a negative impact on job satisfaction indirectly by way of job performance, while family-work conflict has a detrimental effect on affective organizational commitment indirectly via job performance and job satisfaction. The results of the path analysis indicate that work-family conflict and job satisfaction are significant determinants of turnover intentions.

This research study examines the relationship between work-family conflict, job satisfaction, and job turnover intention among female university teachers considering a situation in Pakistan as a case-in-point. Research Methodology: Questionnaire surveys were personally administered and data was collected from some of the university female teachers in Pakistan. Tests for normality, correlation and regression were employed to test the hypotheses and answer the research questions. Findings: The results revealed that work-family conflict is explained by job satisfaction which impacts job turnover intention amongst the female faculty. Besides, work-life conflict and job turnover intention exert negative indirect effects on the one's job satisfaction. Additionally, job turnover intention is strongly explained by job satisfaction, and job satisfaction is predicted by work-family conflict Research Limitation: The current study has a few limitations that must be stated. First, the research was conducted in only a few universities in Pakistan as it's difficult to collect data from all the universities. Consequently, its findings are not applicable to other industries in the country. Nonetheless based on the basic concepts of this study, a comparative research with different countries (e.g. Pakistan vs. India, Pakistan vs. Bangladesh) that investigates similar variables could be conducted in the future. Second limitation was that this study was carried out within a short time frame with limited resources. Originality/Value: This study contributes in two ways.

The project also aims to provide a global view that complements the traditional American/Western view. The purpose of this study is to investigate and report on some of these factors, in particular, the role that job satisfaction has in turnover intention (i.e., changing jobs within the IT industry) and turn-away intention (i.e., moving to another industry other than IT) in South Africa. Background Several studies have reported on the importance of an employee’s job satisfaction to organisation success, and the various factors that influence it. Most studies on job satisfaction adopted a Westernised and not a global view. Very few empirical studies have been conducted on job satisfaction of IT workers in South Africa. This paper reports on the individual, personal and organisational factors that influence the job satisfaction of IT staff in South Africa. Methodology The study uses statistical analysis of survey data acquired through the World IT Project. Both online and paper based questionnaires were used. A sample size of 301 respondents was obtained from the survey, which was conducted over a period of 6 months during 2017. The factors that influence IT job satisfaction were analysed using correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis and discriminant analysis. The factors investigated were employee and organisational demographics, aspects of occupational culture, and various job-related individual issues. Contribution This paper presents the only study focused specifically on turnover and turn-away intention amongst IT staff in South Africa. The final proposed model, grounded in the empirical dataset, clearly shows job satisfaction as a strong mediating construct explaining most of the variance in the IT professional’s intention to leave the organisation (i.e. their turnover intention) and the industry (i.e. their turn-away intention). Findings The findings revealed that there was a significant correlation between job satisfaction and turnover intention as well as between job satisfaction and turn-away intention of IT staff. Perceived professional self-efficacy, strain and experience were also highly correlated with turnover intention. Professional self-efficacy was also significantly correlated with turn-away intention. Based on the analyses that were conducted, a research model is presented that shows the relationships between the various antecedents of turnover and turn-away intention. Recommendations Managers in organisations dealing with the shortage of IT skills can use the for Practitioners model to plan interventions to reduce IT staff turnover rates by focussing on addressing the identified individual issues such as strain, job (in)security and work load as well as the personal value and IT occupational culture issues. Recommendations Researchers in the field of IT staff recruitment and management can find value for Researchers for their research in the proposed refined model of IT job satisfaction and turnover intention. Future research could possibly replicate the study in other countries or could focus on different factors. Impact on Society IT skills play a crucial role in society today and are therefore in high demand. However, this demand is not being satisfied by the current rate of supply. Research into what factors influence IT staff to leave the organisation or the industry can assist managers with improving their employee relations and job conditions so as to reduce this turnover and increase organisations’ and society’s competitiveness and economic growth. Future Research It would be interesting to determine if the findings are similar for a sample of smaller organisations and/or younger IT employees since this study focussed on larger organisations and more experienced staff. Future research could also compare the findings of South African organisations with those in other countries. © 2019 Informing Science Institute. All rights reserved.

Two aspects are considered in this context: firstly, the employees' enthusiasm for the profession and organisation, the nature of the work and its impact on social and family life. Secondly, their level of satisfaction with the job in terms of organisational loyalty, relationship with supervisors, job security, earnings and additional benefits. A theoretical model (see Fig. 1) and seven hypotheses are tested to indicate whether the employees' level of agreement with statements about the job and their level of satisfaction with the job will impact their intentions to quit. The study further examines if any current employees intend to leave their job. The term luxury hotel is used to represent 5 star and 4 star hotels of India.Findings from the analyses of 884 responses suggest that, when considering intentions to resign from the job, a negative relationship is found between professional and organisational enthusiasm and perceptions about the work being stimulating. No support was found for a positive relationship between the extent work impacted social and family life and the intention to quit. However, results supported the notion that the employee's organisational loyalty has a negative effect on his/her intention to resign from the job. Our findings contradict several other studies in that they suggest the employee's intention to resign from the job increases as job security and earnings improve. The study is distinctive as it explores intentions luxury hotel employees in India to leave their jobs; three is little evidence in the wider literature of similar attempts in the context of the Indian hotel industry. The outcomes have implications for both theory and practice as this is the first such major study in the context of the hotel industry in India where there is a population of over a billion people and an expanding hotel industry. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach: The data for this empirical study were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews with 15 employees who had experience of working in various hotels in Macau, China. The thematic analysis approach was carried out to analyze the interview data and interpret the findings. Findings: The findings of this study demonstrate that although employee-oriented human resource policies and practices are favored, the way HR department handles and implement those policies are valued more by hotel employees. Furthermore, the retention of an organizational culture that helps create a feeling of ownership among employees is highly influenced by employees’ turnover intentions. The current study demonstrates that the HR department in hotels holds a powerful position, and therefore, hotel employees expect their HR department to play greater and proactive roles in the HRM apart from providing equitable opportunities for their growth. This implication is particularly important for Integrated Resorts where a large number of employees collectively work to serve a range of customers who visit hotels for a variety of purposes. Practical implications: This study suggests that addressing employees’ needs particularly those related to resolving complaints and managing relationships with other colleagues and providing opportunities for employees’ family members to take part in the organization’s activities and use its facilities are important practices that HR department can initiate to encourage employees’ engagement in hotels. Furthermore, the study shows that managers need to understand their employees’ perspectives as they can help resolve problems at the root level where they grow, and send a signal to the employees that the management is genuinely interested in resolving their problems and making them happy and satisfied. Originality/value: Although several studies have provided valuable insights into the relationship between HRM practices and employee turnover intentions, most of those studies have used quantitative approaches to collect and analyze data. Furthermore, almost none of the findings were derived from the hotel sector.

In addition, when the impact of variables on employee attrition was analyzed, variables such as environmental satisfaction, overtime work, and relationship satisfaction were found to be the biggest contributors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd Employee attrition; Ensemble; Machine learning; Predictive model"", ""Automated Early Prediction of Employee Attrition in Industry Using Machine Learning Algorithms Several companies and organizations all over the world face redoubtable challenges in recruiting eligible and talented employee candidates, while at the same time enduring the risk of employee attrition caused as a result of death, resignation, or retirement. Employee attrition is one of the key issues that firms face today when endeavoring to retain their valuable and skilled workers. Losing talented employees results in a negative impact on the company's performance. Organizations suffer a huge loss in terms of recruitment costs, training costs, etc. which are incurred for an employee's upliftment. The departure of such employees can also reduce morale, increase stress, and over-burden the team members. Businesses can no longer rely on conventional business practices to promote growth due to the increase of a massive amount of data and the continuously changing preferences. Hence, artificial intelligence and machine learning open up a new realm of possibilities to drive business growth through actionable insights. The objective of this study is to determine why employees depart on their initiative, what might have kept them from doing so, and how to use this information to predict attrition risk. This research study uses three machine learning models to conduct the employee attrition prediction on the IBM Watson dataset having 35 features.

Employee retention strategies will be helpful in motivating employees and engaging them for maximum period of time so that they can contribute effectively. In order to ensure growth and learning for the employees in their current assignments and for them to enjoy their work genuine efforts need to be taken by the management. In the current scenario employee retention has become a major concern for corporate houses. There is a tendency among employees to move to other organizations for better prospects. An employee looks for a change because of lucrative salary, comfortable timings, better ambience and growth prospects. It is the responsibility of the management and the human resource team to intervene immediately and find out the exact reasons whenever a talented employee expresses his willingness to move on. For an organization's success it is vital to retain positive and motivated staff. There is a negative effect on company's morale because of high labor turnover as it increases expenses. Implementation of employee retention program is the only way of making sure that the key workers remain employed at the same time maintaining job performance and productivity. This paper aims to focus particularly on a review of extant literature on employee retention. Conclusions and implications for further research have been drawn from the literature reviewed. © IAEME Publication.

IT sector is one of the most growing sectors and facing the challenge of employee turnover at a high rate. The objective of the study was to investigate the contribution of talent management practices in employee retention. A descriptive study was conducted to find the impact of talent management strategies on employee retention. A multiple regression model was developed to analyze the relationship between the variable of talent management and employee retention. It was found that employees prefer to stay in an organization that provides the opportunity to develop and grow on the career ladder also the compensation plans are very helpful in attract and retain the employees. The study will be useful for planning, drafting, and executing various strategies to retain the employee. The study can be generalized to other sectors and there is the scope of future research with the other aspects of the workforce e.g. work-life balance, employee engagement in connection with employee retention. \u200b. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC. employee retention; employee turnover; recruitment; salary; talent management', 'Inclusive talent management philosophy, talent management practices and employees’ outcomes Purpose: This study aims to propose that inclusive talent management (TM) philosophy and TM practices are related to individual outcomes, such as job satisfaction, turnover intentions and job performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using the resource-based theory, the research explores the mediation relationship between inclusive TM philosophy and job satisfaction, turnover intentions and job performance via TM practices. The study uses structural equation modelling for analysing the data collected through a questionnaire-based survey among a sample of 373 employees and 65 supervisors. Findings: The results show that inclusive TM philosophy is positively related to individuals’ job satisfaction, job performance and decreased turnover intentions, through TM practices. Research limitations/implications: The study’s limitation lies in its restriction to a narrow set of organizations operating in Romania, thus limiting the generalization of the findings. Consequently, future studies can extend the scope of the study to include a larger sample size consisting of more organizations operating across multiple sectors and countries. While it is appropriate to assess talent philosophies at the level of the individual employees, future studies may wish to tackle the constructs from the organizational (managerial) standpoint where the TM practices and programmes are designed. Furthermore, future researchers could draw comparisons with large enterprises to investigate the differences in the impact of implementing TM practices within these organizational types. Finally, future research could explore the outcomes of inclusive TM philosophy by using a qualitative design, which sheds more light on other factors that support or hinder the outcomes of embracing inclusive TM in organizations. Practical implications: The study’s findings have practical implications for organizations that want to improve their employees’ outcomes and provide evidence on how organizations can achieve this through their TM practices. First, the paper establishes a relationship between inclusive TM philosophy and employees’ outcomes (turnover intention, job satisfaction and job performance) through the mediating impact of the organization’s TM practices in the context of organizations operating in Romania. The relevance of the context for TM studies has been highlighted in the literature, and thus, the findings make an important contribution to the TM literature, given the limited number of empirical studies on TM practices from emerging European countries (Skuza et al., 2013). Second, the model was tested empirically by collecting data from two sources – employees and supervisors from the surveyed organizations. The perception among employees that they are treated as a talent by the organization can have a positive impact on their satisfaction, and job performance, and decrease their turnover intentions. This suggests that organizations should invest in talent development programmes to help their employees develop into talented performers who help improve the organization’s performance. The findings are of particular importance to human resources practitioners, as it suggests that organizations should consider implementing TM practices systematically across the organization to ensure that all employees benefit from them. By doing this, organizations can improve individual outcomes, which can ultimately lead to improved organizational performance. Social implications: Organization that develop the talent of their workforce in its totality are likely to be more successful in the long term. Similarly, it can be inferred that organizations that enhance the talent of their workforce through practices such as staff rotation, talent identification are likely to derive greater benefit from the capabilities that their staff display. Originality/value: The study sheds light on the impact of talent philosophies and TM practices on outcomes at the individual employees’ level, which is an understudied study area within the broader TM discipline. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Design/methodology/approach - Three hypotheses were developed to investigate six independent variables as possible factors of high job turnover. The research is based on a two-step process consisting of a literature review and field research. The literature review served to establish empirical links among the variables and construct an appropriate questionnaire for the field research. The field research consisted of 38 employees (out of 475) completing a 41-question survey. Individual interviews were also conducted with 20 of the 38 respondents. The paper is an empirically based case analysis. Findings - The results demonstrate that the employees' organizational commitment affects employee turnover. The findings also suggest that organizational commitment can be improved through increased effective communication between management and employees and ensuring that the organization's vision is shared and understood by employees. The link between job satisfaction and turnover was not supported by the research. Research limitations/implications - Sample size was affected due to the limited availability of employees during production hours. Increased sample size would allow further investigation within specific departments and shifts. Additional research could also have been done on how the company's HR policy mandated from their US head office fits the needs of a Canadian based workforce.

Canada; Communication; Employee turnover; Job satisfaction; Production processes"", 'Modeling the determinants of turnover intentions: a Bayesian approach Purpose: Much of what we learn from empirical research is based on a specific empirical model(s) presented in the literature. However, the range of plausible models given the data is potentially larger, thus creating an additional source of uncertainty termed: model uncertainty. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of model uncertainty on empirical research in HRM and suggest potential solutions to deal with the same. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of call center employees from India, the authors test the robustness of predictors of intention to leave based on the unfolding model proposed by Harman et.al. (2007). Methodologically, the authors use Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to identify the specific variables within the unfolding model that have a robust relationship with turnover intentions after accounting for model uncertainty. Findings: The findings show that indeed model uncertainty can impact what we learn from empirical studies. More specifically, in the context of the sample, using four plausible model specifications, the authors show that the conclusions can vary depending on which model the authors choose to interpret. Furthermore, using BMA, the authors find that only two variables, job satisfaction and perceived organizational support, are model specification independent robust predictors of intention to leave. Practical implications: The research has specific implications for the development of HR analytics and informs managers on which are the most robust elements affecting attrition. Originality/value: While empirical research typically acknowledges and corrects for the presence of sampling uncertainty through p-values, rarely does it acknowledge the presence of model uncertainty (which variables to include in a model). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first study to show the effect and offer a solution to studying total uncertainty (sampling uncertainty + model uncertainty) on empirical research in HRM. The work should open more doors toward more studies evaluating the robustness of key HRM constructs in explaining important work-related outcomes. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Data were collected from 230 working Indian executives, having median age of 25, from various industries such as Information Technology, Public Sector Units, Pharmacy, and Fast Moving Consumer Goods where they expressed their views on turnover intentions, job satisfaction & pay satisfaction in their respective organizations. The results revealed the negative relationship between turnover intention and job satisfaction and also between turnover intention and pay satisfaction. However, when age is introduced as a variable having a moderating effect on the above relationships, it was noticed that pay satisfaction is more significant than job satisfaction when it comes to intention to quit a job for employees who are relatively experienced having an age greater than the median age of 25; whereas, for employees less than the median age, turnover intention is driven more by job satisfaction than pay satisfaction. Findings from this study offer important implications for theory & research in turnover intention driven by factors like pay satisfaction and job satisfaction with the moderating effect of age of employees. © 2011 XLRI Jamshedpur, School of Business Management & Human Resources. age; India; job satisfaction; pay satisfaction; software industry; turnover intention; young professionals']"

It has been shown to be the best predictor of actual turnover, and turnover has a significant financial impact and also on the provision of care. Aims: The aim is to examine the impact of predictive work environment factors on nurses’ intention to leave their position and to explore contributing factors. Methods: Cross-sectional survey using a convenience sample (n\xa0=\xa0605) of Finnish nurses drawn from five clinical settings. The Nursing Context Index, an internationally used and psychometrically validated tool, was used to measure workplace practice environment, work stress, job satisfaction and intention to leave. A response rate of 29.4% was achieved, exceeding power calculation estimates. Results: Personal satisfaction and satisfaction with profession and resources, and organisational commitment were significantly related to intention to leave. Younger nurses reported higher levels of intention to leave and there was variability among clinical specialties. Measures of stress and practice environment had no significant relationship with intention to leave. Discussion: This study provides a new theoretical model for understanding intention to leave. Having a better understanding of the factors that may help reduce intention to leave allows for targeted interventions to be developed and implemented. This would help reduce the personal and financial implications associated with turnover. Implications for practice, policy, management and education: The findings have significant implications for all aspects of nursing. Educators need to prepare new nursing staff for the working environment; policymakers must ensure that nursing satisfaction is promoted to strengthen organisational commitment and nurse managers and leaders respond accordingly in implementing effective interventions. © 2020 The Authors.

It is a critical dimension in health systems due to the shortage of professionals and the potential impact on the quality of care. The present paper: (i) characterizes organizational commitment and intention to leave; (ii) analyzes the relationship between structural factors (such as, work environment and nurse staffing), individual factors (age), and nurses’ organizational commitments and intention to leave; and (iii) analyzes the differences in the intention to leave and in the organizational commitment according to service specialty, nurses’ specialization, and contractual relationship in Portuguese public hospitals. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 850 nurses from 12 public hospitals units. The results show a high affective and continuance commitment of nurses with the hospital, and a reduced tendency of the intention to leave. A significant positive association was also found between the intent to leave and individual/structural factors. Organizational commitment and intention to leave levels are satisfactory, despite the influence of several factors, such as nurse staffing, work environment, or other opportunities for professional development. The results identify particularly sensitive areas that, through adequate health and management policies, can reduce nurses’ intentions to leave and promote the sustainability of the health system. © 2022 by the authors.

Background: There is currently a shortage of qualified nurses, and healthcare organisations often face challenges in retaining trained nurses. Job satisfaction has been identified as a factor that influences nurse turnover. However, this has not been widely explored in Malaysia. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: Registered nurses in a teaching hospital in Malaysia completed a self-administered questionnaire. Of the 150 questionnaires distributed, 141 were returned (response rate = 94%). Results: Overall, nurses had a moderate level of job satisfaction, with higher satisfaction for motivational factors. Significant effects were observed between job satisfaction and demographic variables. About 40% of the nurses intended to leave their current employment. Furthermore, age, work experience and nursing education had significant associations with intention to leave. Logistic regression analysis revealed that job satisfaction was a significant and independent predictor of nurses' intention to leave after controlling for demographic variables. Conclusion: The results suggest that there is a significant association between job satisfaction and nurses' intention to leave their current employment. It adds to the existing literature on the relationship between nurses' job satisfaction and intention to leave. Relevance to clinical practice: Methods for enhancing nurses' job satisfaction are vital to promote the long-term retention of nurses within organisations. Attention must be paid to the needs of younger nurses, as they represent the majority of the nursing workforce and often have lower satisfaction and greater intention to leave than older nurses do. Strategies to nurture younger nurses, such as providing opportunities for further education, greater management decision-making capabilities and flexible working environment, are essential. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how two prominent individual attributes, education, and allocentrism, create work tension for human capital practices in Chinese companies. Design/methodology/approach – Surveying nearly 500 workers in four Chinese companies and using multi-level methodology. Findings – The authors found that higher levels of education work to the detriment of employees’ affective organizational commitment (AOC) and positively influence seeking-to-leave behavior. In addition, this study suggests a positive relation between allocentrism and AOC. Personalized leadership, a common leadership style in high-power distance cultures such as China, further exacerbates the problems with higher levels of education and diminishes the commitment benefits of allocentrism. Conversely, regardless of leadership style, if supervisors involve workers in decision-making activities, those workers who are more educated will become more committed to the organization and less likely to leave. Research limitations/implications – The data were collected using self-reported questionnaires, which may cause common method variance. The reliability for personalized leadership was slightly below 0.70. This may be due to the multiple dimensions that are reflected in leadership styles. Another limitation of this study is its focus on allocentrism without considering other personal expression of cultural values. This approach could be too narrow (Gelfand et al., 2007). Practical implications – This study suggests that members who endorse allocentrism might be more likely to have high-affective commitment. If managers can select individuals high on the allocentrism scale, there is a higher likelihood these individuals will attach emotionally to the organization. Managers should not simply conclude that idiocentrics are “worse” employees than allocentrics. Instead, managers may utilize effective management tactics to cultivate more socialized leadership visions among their supervisors. Finally, the authors find that independent of whether leadership is more or less personalized, managers can retain valued educated workers by including them in decision-making activities. Social implications – The authors have found that education may serve as a double edged sword for employers. As hypothesized, the findings suggested that employees’ level of education negatively relates to their affective commitment for their organizations. This study also contributes to the knowledge on the role of culture at the individual level (i.e. allocentrism) and how it affects employees’ attitudes and behavior. The authors found that workers who more highly value the group that they function within (allocentrics) tend to be more affectively committed to their organization. Originality/value – It is one of the first studies to examine educational level and cultural orientation as antecedents to affective commitment, especially in Chinese businesses where workers’ education level is a growing phenomenon and allocentrism is a traditional characteristic of Chinese workers. Also, understanding the dynamics of group-individual linkages is generally most helpful to understanding organizational phenomenon (House et al., 1995).

Design/methodology/approach: The study utilized structured equation modeling to analyze survey data from 437 Chinese employees of five multinational enterprises operating in the Chinese service sector. Findings: The study found that POS was positively related to affective organizational commitment, which in turn was negatively related to turnover intentions. A direct relationship was revealed between PSS and turnover intentions, as well as a mediated relationship through POS. In contrast, the relationship between intra-organizational network resources and turnover intentions was fully mediated through POS. Research limitations/implications: The cross sectional design is a limitation of the study. Another limitation regards the generalisability of the findings outside the specific research context. Future research should be extended to different geographical and organizational settings. Practical implications: In order to promote employee retention, multinational enterprises operating in China could start by carefully targeting visible support on offer to their employees. Improving supervisor support is a relatively inexpensive and practical measure compared to the costly alternatives such as improving employee compensation, training and career development. Organizations should also consider improving co-worker support schemes in the workplace which enable individuals to build up their network resources. Originality/value: The study provided evidence for both a direct relationship between PSS and turnover intentions and a mediated one via POS, confirming the generalisability of previous findings to the Chinese context. In addition it made an original contribution by establishing that POS fully, rather than partially mediated the relationship between intra-organizational network resources and turnover intentions. This suggests that Chinese employees attribute instrumental and expressive support from others in the organization as coming from the organization itself. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Findings: The results suggest that distributive justice, trust in organisation and job security have negative impacts on turnover intention. Moreover, affective commitment mediates the impact of job security on turnover intention.

9,63,9_nursing_hospital_nurse_the,"['nursing', 'hospital', 'nurse', 'the', 'hospitals', 'in', 'of', 'to', 'nurses', 'and']","[""The effects of work restructuring on Low-Wage, Low-Skilled workers in U.S. hospitals Although commonly thought of as an employer of highly educated and technically skilled medical staff, the U.S. hospital industry also provides large numbers of low-skill, low-wage jobs. Food service, housekeeping, and nursing assistant jobs make up the largely invisible backbone of any U.S. hospital. These jobs have traditionally provided employment with benefits to some of the most economically disadvantaged participants in the U.S. labor force, including recent immigrants and residents of the inner city. Over the past fifteen years the U.S. hospital industry has come under considerable pressure to reduce costs and streamline services while continuing to provide high-quality medical care to an increasingly demanding public. Recently hospitals have begun experimenting with alternative approaches to structuring low-skill, low-wage jobs. As hospitals exhausted other routes to cost-cutting and service improvement, some managers began experimenting with the redesign of these roles. At the same time, exceptionally tight labor markets in the latter half of the 1990s made recruiting and retention of even low-skilled workers an important concern. Some managers initiated the redesign of work processes with the goal of increasing job satisfaction among these workers and reducing turnover. The purpose of this chapter is to explore the impacts of these changes on the current jobs of workers employed in housekeeping, in food service, or in patient care as nursing assistants in U.S. hospitals. These are low-wage jobs that generally require a high school degree or less to perform adequately. 1 We document the changes in work organization in these low-skill, low-wage occupations and analyze how these changes affect the turnover and job satisfaction of these workers. Despite these changes, within-hospital career mobility for workers in these low-skill occupations remains extremely limited. This chapter provides some limited evidence on what those paths look like and how they may be changing. The research presented here was conducted in 16 U.S. community hospitals. We chose to focus on community hospitals because they make up the largest proportion of U.S. hospitals. We also chose hospitals of a similar size-between 200 and 400 beds for the most part-again, as the most representative size of community hospitals. Our research sites were chosen to provide insight into hospital practices throughout the country: we conducted fieldwork in hospitals based in the Northeast, the Midwest, the Southwest, and the South. At each hospital we met with and interviewed managers; in addition to an executive-level manager, we interviewed managers from human resources as well as the managers of food service, housekeeping, and hospital units in which nursing assistants were employed. In addition to this field research, the research presented here draws on completed telephone interviews with 746 workers employed in food service, in housekeeping, or as nursing assistants in 12 of these hospitals. Approximately 80 workers per hospital were randomly selected from employee lists supplied by the employer for the telephone interviews. We present evidence on the changing nature of employment and careers in this sector. In interviews with hospital managers we gathered information on the pressures facing their hospitals. In addition, we heard from managers about strategies they had implemented (and that some had later abandoned) to cope with the need to continue to drive down costs while providing high-quality health care. We also heard from the employees about their careers to date and about their current jobs. We asked them where they had worked before, where they planned to be working in the next few years, and what they did now at work. We also asked about changes in their jobs, the skills and abilities they brought to the hospital, and the effects their jobs had on them. We find that higher wages and staffing adequacy in departments are key management measures that reduce employees' desire to leave their current employers. However, as we discuss later in this chapter, hospitals face rising expenses and severe cost pressures that challenge their ability to raise wages and improve staffing levels. Changes in work processes for low-skilled workers, intro duced in an effort both to improve quality and reduce costs, have been rather modest. In contrast to the traditional organization of low-skill jobs in hospitals, workers in enhanced jobs perform a broader range of work tasks and are assigned to specific departments. We find from the worker survey that these jobs are not more likely than jobs in traditional work settings to have any of the characteristics associated with high-performance work organization, such as participation in teams, pay contingent on performance, higher levels of training, and employment security. The emphasis on cost-cutting appears to have precluded more far-reaching changes in work redesign. And where we do find enhanced jobs, we also find that workers in these jobs are no more satisfied with their jobs than are other workers. However, we do find that enhanced jobs have been effective in reducing employees' intention to quit their jobs. The evidence presented in this chapter is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. The chapter begins with an overview of the U.S. hospital industry, the pressures facing the industry, and a description of the occupational groups that are the focus of this study. We also present data on the career patterns of the workers interviewed in this study, both where they have come from and where they plan to go. We then describe their current jobs and the primary models of work organization-traditional, enhanced, and contracted out-that employers appear to be adopting in their efforts to restructure low-skill, low-wage jobs in U.S. hospitals. In the next section, we explore the impact that unions are having on the choices that hospital managers make with respect to new models of work organization, and we describe the implications of these changes for these workers' careers. Finally, we analyze the empirical data on the impact of various models of work organization on the work lives of low-wage workers in the U.S. hospital industry. Using the worker survey data, we analyze work organization effects on employees' intention to leave their employer and on employee satisfaction. The chapter concludes with a discussion of our findings. Copyright © 2003 by Russell Sage Foundation. All rights reserved. "", 'Good jobs, hard work? Employment models for nurse\'s aides and hospital housekeepers Of the five sectors studied in this book, the hospital sector may display the largest number of distinctive features. It combines characteristics of both industry and the service sector. On the ""industrial"" side, its activities depend on major investments in equipment and rapid technical progress. It is subject to the classic production constraints of a twenty-four-hour-a-day, 365-day-a-year operation, the quest for ""error-proof"" work, and rising demands for full accountability. But caregiving is also a service that mobilizes a vast workforce and rests in part on coproduction between the patient and the staff, whether through discussions of diagnosis between the patient and the medical and nursing staff or through the patient\'s necessary participation in basic nursing tasks such as washing and moving from one place to another. It is also a sector largely dominated by public organizations: The majority of workers in public hospitals are in civil service jobs. The hospital sector expanded greatly in the 1960s and 1970s, at a time when the internal labor market model was being constructed. It displays most of the characteristics of the French model described in chapter 2, sometimes in the extreme. Although the hospital sector employs primarily skilled and highly skilled workers, it also provides a large percentage of semiskilled or unskilled jobs, especially housekeeping and basic nursing jobs, on which this chapter focuses. In the United States the vast majority of these jobs are performed by unskilled workers and the turnover rate for housecleaning staff is high (Appelbaum et al. 2003). We have chosen these tasks as the basis for the international comparison. In France, the organization and structure of work and the skill level of the workforce differ significantly from the American model. Nurse\'s aides and housecleaning staff are better trained and have more stable jobs (at least those who form the core of permanent employees) and do not belong to the category of low-wage workers. In fact, the hospital sector has the lowest rate of such workers in France (see chapter 2). This is also true for Holland and Denmark but not for Germany, the United Kingdom, or the United States. The first section explains the high level of regulation in the French hospital sector, both of the labor market and of the conditions for providing care. Regulation accounts for the negligible incidence of low wages and for a greater homogeneity between the public and private sectors than might be expected. In both subsectors, nursing and housekeeping tasks are job categories that are well defined in collective bargaining agreements, though the actual work organization may vary from one hospital to another. Both jobs can be considered more highly skilled than in the United States. Housekeepers also have higher skills than their counterparts in French hotels. This factor is another reason for the negligible incidence of low wages. The next section analyzes another important characteristic of the French hospital employment model: its high level of segmentation. On the one hand, there are a great many workers in the sector with very stable jobs-civil service employment in the public sector, open-ended contracts in the private-and a low turnover rate. The model of ""employment for life"" persists, even for nurse\'s aides and housekeepers. These jobs are more attractive than elsewhere because of their stability, the wage progression based on seniority, and a work schedule that, despite the ""unsocial"" hours, allows for a better balance of family life and work life than in other sectors. That attractiveness explains why there are almost no problems finding qualified job applicants, either in the public or the private sectors. In addition, the model allows hospitals to use a large peripheral reserve labor force working under unstable conditions. Organized on the model of a waiting line, that pool is a powerful instrument of flexibility. Here again, we find some of the exemplary characteristics of the French model as set out in chapter 2. In the following section, we examine the changes under way in relation to that standard model. As in other countries, French hospitals are subject to strong pressures related to the demand for care and the financing system. There have been major restructurings, but they came about later than in the United States or the United Kingdom. That delay explains why the consequences for managing the work- force are not always very significant, especially since institutional resilience leads to a certain uniformity. Of course, both public and private hospitals have reacted with efforts to increase work productivity by requiring higher skills and a faster pace of work. The organization of work is in transition, especially for housekeepers. But there is also some reluctance to implement organizational changes. In the end, though the impact is perceptible, especially in the deterioration of working conditions, the classic model of hospital employment seems to be holding fast. This chapter relies on the general methodology identified for research on low-wage work. It uses a set of national statistical data, primarily from the Ministry of Health (in particular, annual statistics on health institutions and the 2003 survey on working conditions in hospitals).1 Eight case studies were done in 2005 and 2006 on midsized hospitals and clinics (100 to 800 beds, excluding university hospitals). Four are public hospitals, four are private for-profit clinics. Four are located in labor markets with a high rate of unemployment and four in tighter markets (see the appendix for the chief characteristics of the sample).2 In each case study, we conducted between twelve and fifteen in-depth interviews with hospital management (executive director, human resource manager, nursing care manager), union leaders, nurse\'s aides, and hospital service workers, primarily in medical units. In one case, a hospital that subcontracts some of its work, the interviews also dealt with the subcontractor\'s business and workers. Copyright © 2008 by Russell Sage Foundation. All rights reserved. ', 'The role of magnet hospitals in making the nursing practice environment attractive World’s health systems have entered a critical period of human resource shortage. The shortage of qualified nurses has been suggested as one of the most important barriers to achieve effective healthcare systems (1). According to the WHO (2014), there is currently a shortage of 7.2 million health care providers at the international level. This shortage is estimated to reach 12.9 million by 2035 (2). In other words, in order to develop healthcare systems, achieve positive outcomes and ensure patient’s safety, recruiting well-qualified nurses is a global concern (3). Nursing shortage in Iran has also become a concern for managers and a major challenge to the healthcare system. The nursing deputy of the Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education reported that the number of nurses working in health care settings is estimated to be 140,000, but there is a need for 2,60,000 nurses to deliver ideal levels of health care (4). While, qualified nurses adequacy is one of the essential components of the nursing professional practice environment (5). Poor nursing work environment, inadequate resources, imbalanced workload, disproportionate nursepatient ratio, high bureaucracy (5), lack of supportive management, low salaries, and reduction in employment are major challenges that have caused Iran’s healthcare system to face a serious crisis of nursing shortage despite a large number of young nursing graduates (6). Evidence suggests that the nursing practice environment has a significant role in the retention of expert nurses, the quality of care and, safety of patients (7). Poor nursing work environments are related to adverse patient outcomes, including an increase in mortality rate, patient falls, and medication errors (8, 9). In addition, unhealthy workplaces are important causes of turnover, efficient nurses’ intention to leave, early retirement, job dissatisfaction and burnout (10, 11). Therefore, efforts to create environments that attract and retain nurses are worthwhile. Different strategies have been proposed to improve the nurses’ work environment. In this regard, making workplace attractive is a basis for increasing the quality of nursing practice environment (12). Today, there are hospitals called “Magnet Hospital” that are renowned for attracting and retaining expert nurses. The Magnet hospital was first used in the United States. In the early 1980s, concurrent with nursing shortage crisis in the United States, extensive studies were begun to examine the organizational structures of Magnet hospitals. In a study, the American Academy of Nursing (AAN) identified 41 hospitals that were known to attract and retain qualified nurses, and used the term “Magnet” as a gold standard for nursing practice in these hospitals (13). Magnet hospitals are evaluated in terms of achieving goals in five areas including transformational leadership, structural empowerment, new knowledge, innovation, and empirical outcomes and development (14). Magnet hospitals with a more different organizational structure than non-Magnet ones play an important role in nurses’ job satisfaction and retention (15). One of the main reasons for the attractiveness of these hospitals is the existence of work environments focusing on decentralized decision-making, autonomy, control over practice, resource adequacy, supportive management, effective inter-professional communication, and career development (16). In other words, the organizational attributes of Magnet hospitals lead to the nurses’ empowerment by increasing autonomy and authority, and subsequently improving job satisfaction. These hospitals have designed a set of work environment standards to support professional nursing practice (17). Many studies have shown that Magnet hospitals provide a healthier environment with higher job satisfaction for nurses and better outcomes for patients, compared to non-Magnet ones (18, 19). In recent years, the development of Magnet hospitals has rapidly grown in various countries. Considering the complexity of nursing shortage phenomenon, paying attention to the factors influencing the nurses’ attraction, retention and productivity is important to overcome the challenge of nursing shortage (20). Conclusion The nurses’ dissatisfaction with the work environment and consequently, the shortage of competent and educated nurses, is a major challenge to Iran’s health system. Therefore, solving this crisis is vital to prevent adverse health consequences. In this regard, nursing managers and health policy-makers can create a quality work environment using the features of Magnet hospitals to increase the attraction and retention of health care professionals, especially nurses. This will not only result in the nurses’ job satisfaction but will also increase the quality of care and ensure the patients’ safety. © 2017, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS).

As intention to leave is a predictor of turnover, awareness of its associated factors is essential. This study applied a secondary data analysis to evaluate the prevalence and variability of 3,984 nursing home care workers’ intention to leave. Work environment factors and care worker outcomes were tested via multiple regression analysis. Although 56% of care workers reported intention to leave, prevalences varied widely between facilities. Overall, intention to leave showed strong inverse relationships with supportive leadership and affective organizational commitment and weaker positive relationships with stress due to workload, emotional exhaustion, and care worker health problems. The strong direct relationship of nursing home care workers’ intention to leave with affective organizational commitment and perceptions of leadership quality suggest that multilevel interventions to improve these factors might reduce intention to leave. © The Author(s) 2017. affective organizational commitment; intention to leave; leadership; nursing homes; physical health', ""Personal care workers in Australian aged care: Retention and turnover intentions Aim: This study examined factors influencing personal care workers' intentions to stay or leave Australian aged care employment - especially for older workers. Background: Retention of personal care workers is particularly important in aged care as they provide the majority of the direct care via community aged care or long-term aged care environments. However, there is limited research on what drives their turnover and retention. Method: A survey was conducted during 2012 collecting 206 responses from workers within community and long-term aged care in four organisations in Australia. Result: Perceived supervisor support, on-the-job embeddedness and area of employment were identified as predictors of both intention to stay and to leave, although the relationship strength differed. Community care workers were more likely to stay and reported more supervisor support than long-term care workers. Unexpectedly, age and health status were not predictors of staying or leaving. Conclusion: While there are similarities between retention and turnover motivators, there are also differences. Within a global context of health worker shortages, such new knowledge is keenly sought to enhance organisational effectiveness and sustain the provision of quality aged care. Implications for nursing management: Retention strategies for older workers should involve increasing supervisor support, and seeking to embed workers more fully within their organisation. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This situation is further complicated by the increasing cultural diversity of residents and staff. To retain direct care workers, it is crucial to explore their perceptions of the rewards and difficulties of care work, and their employment intentions in multicultural environments. A qualitative descriptive study was used to understand perceptions of the rewards and difficulties of residential aged care work for core direct care workers (i.e. nurses and nursing assistants), how these were related to their intentions to stay or leave, and how these varied between nurses and nursing assistants, and between locally and overseas born workers. Individual interviews were conducted between June and September 2013 with 16 direct care workers in an Australian residential aged care facility with a specific focus on people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. It was found that direct care workers' employment intentions were related to their perceptions and management of the rewards and difficulties of care work. Their experiences of care work, the employment characteristics, and the organizational resources that fitted their personality, ability, expectations, and essential needs were viewed as rewards. Evaluating their jobs as meaningful was a shared perception for direct care workers who intended to stay. Individual workers' perceptions of the rewarding aspects of care work served to counterbalance the challenges of care work, and promoted their intentions to stay. Perceptions and employment intentions varied by occupational groups and by cultural backgrounds. Overseas born direct care workers are valuable resources in residential aged care facility rather than a limitation, but they do require organizational support, such as cultural awareness of the management, English language support, a sense of family, and appropriate job responsibility. The findings indicated that aged care policy makers and service providers should understand the range of individual direct care workers' positive and negative perceptions, and their employment intentions within the context of their roles and their cultural backgrounds. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Design: A cross-sectional survey. Methods: This study was conducted on 317 inpatient ward nurses of six teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran during 1 September 2017–14 November 2018. Clinical nurses were recruited by a multistage random sampling. Data were collected using structured questionnaires of organizational justice, job satisfaction, and nurses' intention to leave. Data were analysed by structural equation modelling using Amos 22 statistical program. Results: The structural equation model demonstrated adequate fit and the hypothesized correlations were partially supported. The findings suggested that the distributive justice (p\xa0<.001; β\xa0=\xa00.24) and interactional justice (p\xa0<.001; β\xa0=\xa00.44) could indirectly affect the nurses' intention to leave the nursing profession via the direct impact on job satisfaction, while job satisfaction had a significant, negative effect on the nurses' intention to leave (p\xa0<.001; β\xa0=\xa0−0.71). Conclusions: According to the results, the model fit was acceptable, suggesting the validity of the final model. Furthermore, distributive and interactional justice could reduce the intention to leave the nursing profession by influencing the job satisfaction of the clinical nurses. Impact: This was one of the first studies to determine the aspects of justice that must be further emphasized by healthcare managers to increase the job satisfaction of nurses and their retention in healthcare systems. The findings indicated that fair interactions have a greater impact on job satisfaction and retention of nurses than procedural and distributive justice.

Background: Nurse shortage is an ongoing and urgent issue worldwide, in which nurse turnover could exacerbate the situation. Newly licensed registered nurses will become the main nursing workforce in the future; however, previous studies have not revealed the specific reasons underlying their turnover intentions. Design: A descriptive cross-sectional design. Methods: A total of 569 newly licensed registered nurses undertaking direct care were recruited from thirteen hospitals from October to November 2018 across Beijing, China.

Structural equation modelling was used to examine the hypothetical model. The study adhered to the STROBE statement for observational studies. Results: In total, 22.3% of newly licensed registered nurses had a high turnover intention. The final model had an acceptable fit and could explain 58% of the variance in turnover intention. The organisational justice was directly related to high work engagement, great nurses’ perception of care quality and low turnover intention. Additionally, organisational justice also had indirect effects on great nurses’ perception of care quality and low turnover intention, which were partially mediated by work engagement.

The greater emphasis on training and retraining, much of it specific to the firm, results also in steeper wage trajectories, due to growth of skills in the firm. Several previous studies viewed the differences between Japanese and U.S. labor markets in the light of the same hypothesis. We explore this insight more thoroughly by a detailed use of microdata for the two countries: we measure wage profiles and turnover in age groups and we test the inverse relation between the two on industry sectors within each of the countries. Numerical estimates of this relation permit us to conclude that as much as two-thirds of the differential in turnover between the two countries is explainable by the differences in the steepness of the profiles. The question remains why the emphasis on human capital formation on the job is so much greater in Japan than in the United States. Our answer is that such emphasis is conditioned by rapid economic growth. More specifically, Japanese labor policies in the firm represent adjustments of worker skills and activities to the very rapid technological changes of the past decades. Using productivity growth indexes for industries in the United States and Japan we test the hypothesis that rapid technical change, which induces greater and continuous training, is in part responsible for steeper profiles and for lesser turnover. The hypothesis is confirmed on the sectoral level in both countries. We conclude that differences in productivity growth between the United States and Japan account for up to 80% of the differences in the steepness of wage profiles, and indirectly for the differences in turnover. Finally, we try to standardize for the cultural background of workers, by observing a sample of Japanese plants in the United States which employ American workers and use Japanese labor policies in recruitment and training. We find that the steeper tenure-wage slopes and lower turnover place this sample closer to Japan than to the United States-about two-thirds of the distance. © 1988.

', 'Russian labour market: Problems and perspectives One of the main concerns is difficulty of assessing labour market situation and determining perspectives of its development in quickly changing environment. In scientific literature there is no comprehensive analysis of the Russian labour market facing economic and ""geopolitical crisis"" because of non-typical situation. As a result of expanding world economic relations, large-scale globalization stable international economic and industrial links are destroyed by means of artificial sanctions aimed at isolating a significant subject of world economic relations. In such conditions comprehensive analysis of labour market becomes more and more actual. It can be carried out with the help of different economic and scientific methods including factor analysis and PEST-analysis. Analyzing factors dynamics for a definite time period enables us to reveal key features of the analyzed market, explain tendencies of its development and to develop a forecast for the future period. At that it is important to highlight those factors the influence of which will be dominating for this particular labour market. Efficiency of labour market control depends to the larger extent on the chosen measures. PEST-analysis is considered to be the most reasonable for this purpose. For researching the labour market the following factors are considered to be actual: demographic; political and geopolitical; economic; social and cultural tendencies; technological innovations. Because of structural changes in market economy there is a necessity of proportional development of production factors including labour force. Modern labour market is characterized by high labour force turnover. Among young employees there is a stable tendency to change jobs with acquiring professional experience. Regional labour markets are subject to migration processes that in its turn can affect the balance of supply and demand of labour force. Structural unemployment is exacerbating as a result of production modernization in regions that lack qualified labour force, and is worsening being affected by risks of closing or cutting some manufactures. Inter-firm or inter-industry transfers of labour force will be increasing as a result of restructuring of economic environment. High school graduates cannot realize their career potential and find job according to their specialty. Geo-political state of Russia is likely to worsen world position of the country than to strengthen it, that in its turn negatively influence the labour market. In the light of Russia\'s implementing retaliatory import sanctions there will be a necessity to expand domestic production that can stimulate additional job creating in the country and provide part of working population with jobs. © 2015 Kalmyk Scientific Centre of Russian Academy of Sciences.

Results indicate that workplace-derived injury and illness are associated with poor perceptions of safety climate, and that perceptions of safety climate mediate the relationship between workplace-derived injuries and sick days and three outcome variables (job stress, turnover intention, and job satisfaction). It is argued that health care managers need to engage in positively enhancing the precipitating environment and conditions that may lead to health care accidents, injuries, and illnesses in order to improve safety climate perceptions and employee outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. Health care; Nursing; Safety climate; Turnover; Workplace injury"", 'Best practices to promote occupational safety and satisfaction: A comparison of three north American hospitals Purpose-Hospitals in North America consistently have employee injury rates ranking among the highest of all industries. Organizations that mandate workplace safety training and emphasize safety compliance tend to have lower injury rates and better employee safety perceptions. However, it is unclear if the work environment in different national health care systems (United States vs. Canada) is associated with different employee safety perceptions or injury rates. This study examines occupational safety and workplace satisfaction in two different countries with employees working for the same organization. Methodology/approach-Survey data were collected from environmental services employees (n = 148) at three matched hospitals (two in Canada and one in the United States). The relationships that were examined included: (1) safety leadership and safety training with individual/unit safety perceptions; (2) supervisor and coworker support with individual job satisfaction and turnover intention; and (3) unit turnover, labor usage, and injury rates. Findings-Hierarchical regression analysis and ANOVA found safety leadership and safety training to be positively related to individual safety perceptions, and unit safety grade and effects were similar across all hospitals. Supervisor and coworker support were found to be related to individual and organizational outcomes and significant differences were found across the hospitals. Significant differences were found in injury rates, days missed, and turnover across the hospitals. Originality/value-This study offers support for occupational safety training as a viable mechanism to reduce employee injury rates and that a codified training program translates across national borders. Significant differences were found between the hospitals with respect to employee and organizational outcomes (e.g., turnover). These findings suggest that work environment differences are reflective of the immediate work group and environment, and may reflect national health care system differences. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited. employee injury; employee turnover; HR practices; occupational safety; training programs', 'Occupational Health and Safety Management and Turnover Intention in the Ghanaian Mining Sector Background The mining industry is considered as one of the most dangerous and hazardous industries and the need for effective and efficient occupational health and safety management is critical to safeguard workers and the industry. Despite the dangers and hazards present in the mining industry, only few studies have focused on how occupational health and safety and turnover intentions in the mines. Method The study suing a cross-sectional survey design collected quantitative data from the 255 mine workers that were conveniently sampled from the Ghanaian mining industry. The data collection tools were standardized questionnaires that measured occupational health and safety management and turnover intentions. These scales were also pretested before their usage in actual data collection. Results The correlation coefficient showed that a negative relationship existed between dimensions of occupational health and safety management and turnover intention; safety leadership (r = -0.33, p < 0.01); supervision (r = -0.26, p < 0.01); safety facilities and equipment (r = -0.32, p < 0.01); safety procedure (r = -0.27, p < 0.01). Among these dimensions, safety leadership and safety facility were significant predictors of turnover intention, (β = -0.28, p < 0.01) and (β = -0.24, p < 0.01) respectively. The study also found that turnover intention of employees is heavily influenced by the commitment of safety leadership in ensuring the effective formulation of policies and supervision of occupational health and safety at the workplace. Conclusion The present study demonstrates that safety leadership is crucial in the administration of occupational health and safety and reducing turnover intention in organizations. © 2015, Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute.

The stress literature suggests that the fear of losing one's job could be as detrimental as losing the job itself, and numerous studies indicate that job insecurity may indeed have important consequences for both the individual and the organization. However, the effects of job insecurity are typically greater with regard to short-term rather than long-term consequences. Therefore, the aim of this article is to investigate if short-term consequences (job satisfaction and organizational commitment) mediate the impact of job insecurity on long-term outcomes (mental health complaints and turnover intention). Survey data from four European countries show that the effect of job insecurity on turnover intention is mediated by organizational commitment and job satisfaction. In contrast, it appears that work attitudes partially mediate the effect of job insecurity on mental health complaints.

Testing a cross-lagged longitudinal mediation model Prior cross-sectional research indicates that the negative effects of quantitative job insecurity (i.e., threat to job loss) on employees’ wellbeing are fully mediated by qualitative job insecurity (i.e., threat to job characteristics). In the current longitudinal study, we replicated and further extended this view to include a direct effect of qualitative job insecurity on quantitative job insecurity. We explored these reciprocal relations in the context of their concurrent effects on work related outcomes by means of dual-mediation modelling. We identified a wide range of the outcomes, classified as: job strains (i.e., exhaustion, emotional and cognitive impairment), psychological coping reactions (i.e., job satisfaction, work engagement, turnover intention), and behavioral coping reactions (i.e., in-role and extra role performance, counterproductive behavior). We employed a three-wave panel design and surveyed 2003 Flemish employees. The results showed that the dual-mediation model had the best fit to the data. However, whereas qualitative job insecurity predicted an increase in quantitative job insecurity and the outcome variables six months later, quantitative job insecurity did not affect qualitative job insecurity or the outcomes over time. The study demonstrates the importance of qualitative job insecurity not only as a severe work stressor but also as an antecedent of quantitative job insecurity. Herewith, we stress the need for further research on the causal relations between both dimensions of job insecurity. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In fact, job insecurity represents a crucial occupational risk factor and a major job stressor that has negative consequences on both organizational well-being and individual health. Many studies have focused on the consequences about the fear and the perception of losing the job as a whole (called quantitative job insecurity), while more recently research has begun to examine more extensively the worries and the perceptions of losing valued job features (called qualitative job insecurity). The vast majority of the studies, however, have investigated the effects of quantitative and qualitative job insecurity separately. In this paper, we proposed the Job Insecurity Integrated Model aimed to examine the effects of quantitative job insecurity and qualitative job insecurity on their short-term and long-term outcomes. This model was empirically tested in two independent studies, hypothesizing that qualitative job insecurity mediated the effects of quantitative job insecurity on different outcomes, such as work engagement and organizational identification (Study 1), and job satisfaction, commitment, psychological stress and turnover intention (Study 2). Study 1 was conducted on 329 employees in private firms, while Study 2 on 278 employees in both public sector and private firms. Results robustly showed that qualitative job insecurity totally mediated the effects of quantitative on all the considered outcomes. By showing that the effects of quantitative job insecurity on its outcomes passed through qualitative job insecurity, the Job Insecurity Integrated Model contributes to clarifying previous findings in job insecurity research and puts forward a framework that could profitably produce new investigations with important theoretical and practical implications. © 2017 Chirumbolo, Urbini, Callea, Lo Presti and Talamo.

METHODS: Structural equation modelling and questionnaire. RESULTS: Pay satisfaction, satisfaction with supervisor, satisfaction with work itself, and satisfaction with promotion have positive impacts on employee engagement significantly. Pay satisfaction, satisfaction with supervisor, satisfaction with promotion, satisfaction with co-workers have negative impacts on turnover intention. Employee engagement has a negative impact on turnover intention. Employee engagement partially mediates the relationships between satisfaction with supervisor and turnover intention as well as satisfaction with promotion and turnover intention. The moderating roles of position level between satisfaction with supervisor, satisfaction with co-workers and turnover intention have been supported by data.

A total of 571 complete responses from full-time employees in Korean organizations were utilized for data analysis with structural equation modeling (SEM). This study analyzed two research models through the competing model approach: One model (Model 1) specified that job and personal resources directly influence job performance and turnover intention and also indirectly influence job performance and turnover intention through work engagement, whereas the other model (Model 2) specified that job and personal resources only indirectly influence turnover intention and job performance through work engagement. The results of the competing models demonstrated that overall, Model 2 adequately fit better than Model 1. The results also showed that the direct effects of job and personal resources on work engagement, as well as the direct effects of work engagement on job performance and turnover intention were statistically significant. In addition, the results of the study revealed statistically significant mediating effects of work engagement, not only on the relationship between job and personal resources and job performance, but also on the relationship between job and personal resources and turnover intention.

This study aimed to examine how organizational factors, particularly leadership, affect child welfare worker turnover intentions in order to help child welfare agencies establish a practice model that prevents the turnover of qualified workers. In order to do so, it is important to examine the effects of organizational commitment on employees’ turnover intentions. A cross-sectional survey was distributed among workers in public child welfare agencies in a Midwestern state in the United States (N = 214). A path model was developed to test the direct and indirect effects of transformational leadership on the turnover intentions of child welfare workers using STATA. The survey results indicated that the transformational leadership styles of local office directors had direct and negative effects on child welfare workers’ turnover intentions.

While this has been studied extensively, little attention has been paid to turnover based upon job roles. Like social workers in child welfare, the field of child care also experiences high turnover. Child care workers employed in child welfare settings are no exception. The current study seeks to understand differential factors that impact intent to leave for preventive and child care workers employed in child welfare agencies. Materials and methods: Data for prevention workers (n = 538) were obtained from all preventive service programs under contract with the City. Data for child care workers (n = 222) were obtained from three voluntary agencies located elsewhere in the State. The instrument was a modified version of a survey developed to examine job satisfaction and potential turnover among public child welfare workers. Domains measured included job satisfaction, intention to leave, career commitment, and agency investment. Data were analyzed using bivariate analysis and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results: Child care workers had more positive perceptions of child welfare and planned to stay in child welfare longer. Despite this, prevention workers felt more invested in their work. Child care and prevention workers had different levels of satisfaction with their jobs although overall job satisfaction did not differ nor did their intention to leave. Tenure at the agency was predictive of career investment. Investment, perceptions of child welfare, satisfaction with nature of work, and contingent rewards were associated with career commitment. Commitment and satisfaction with supervision were the greatest predictors of intention to leave. Discussion: There is a gap in literature addressing child care workers in child welfare, and future study of this group is needed. Child care workers are just as likely to intend to leave their jobs as prevention workers. For both groups, it appears that investment in their jobs increases commitment to the field which reduces intention to leave. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Reasons for leaving include incivility, lack of autonomy, perceptions of unfair treatment and feeling psychologically unsafe at work. This paper sought to investigate additional reasons why mental health professionals intend to quit or to cognitively withdraw from their jobs. What does this paper add to existing knowledge?: Past research on this topic is limited in its scope and data. Mainly fragmented evidence is available about predictors of job satisfaction and turnover intention (i.e. different mental health occupations examined in separate studies). Only two existing studies that examined broader mental health provider groups were limited by including few workforce settings, small sample sizes and insufficiently rigorous statistical analyses. We examined four occupations (mental health nurses, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists), each represented through a large sample in multiple settings, all within one large healthcare network with complex patients. Our contribution is finding additional predictors (supervisory support, emotional exhaustion) of job satisfaction/turnover intention. What are the implications for practice?: Organizations can consider using culture change initiatives to increase civility at work; this includes leadership support and role modelling of workplace behaviours. Leaders should monitor staffing levels and high workloads to pre-empt emotional exhaustion, which predicts turnover. Hiring and training supervisors should involve not only technical expertise, but also ‘soft skills’ necessary for creating civil and supportive work environments. Leaders and managers should use employee feedback data (e.g. organizational surveys) to learn about the workplace environments, and address areas of employees’ concern. Abstract: Introduction Given the global shortage of mental health professionals, high turnover rates within this workforce are concerning. We used United States of America Veterans Health Administration data to add to the limited knowledge about this topic. Aim We examined predictors of turnover intention, or an employee's cognitive withdrawal from their job, in a large sample of direct care mental health professionals, separating among occupations to increase the pragmatic relevance of our findings. Method Survey data from 10\xa0997 mental health employees working in direct patient contact (2432 registered nurses, 3769 social workers, 2520 psychologists and 1276 psychiatrists) were used in a cross-sectional design with structural equation\xa0modelling techniques for model testing. Results Job satisfaction was predicted by civility (courteous and respectful workplace behaviours) and supervisory support. Job satisfaction predicted emotional exhaustion which predicted turnover intention. Job satisfaction also directly predicted turnover intention and turnover plans. Discussion Predictors of job satisfaction included civility and supervisory support. Emotional exhaustion predicted turnover intention. Results inform organizational actions to address these work environment characteristics.

Poor employee wellbeing (i.e., high levels of burnout or low job satisfaction) is associated with poorer consumer outcomes and higher staff turnover. This study set out to examine factors related to job satisfaction, turnover intention and burnout in a group of occupational therapists in mental health. Method: Thirty-four occupational therapists (response rate approximately 60%) in a metropolitan public mental health service participated in a whole-of-service workforce survey. The survey included measures of job satisfaction, turnover intention, burnout, job hindrances, job challenges and job resources and questions about positive and negative aspects of positions and factors that attracted employees to their current position. Results: Burnout was associated with lower job satisfaction and higher turnover intention. Higher job satisfaction was associated with rewards (remuneration and recognition) as well as cognitively challenging work. The variables most significantly associated with poorer wellbeing (higher turnover intention and burnout) were recipient contact demands (perception that contact with service users or families was demanding), and feelings of stress or fatigue. Conclusion: This study provides a detailed analysis of factors associated with job satisfaction, turnover intention and burnout in a group of occupational therapists working in mental health. To promote workforce wellbeing and enhanced retention, interventions to minimise burnout should be implemented and evaluated. These strategies should focus on enhancing job resources such as supervisor support, feedback and participation in decision making as well as building the personal resilience of occupational therapists working in mental health.© 2013 Occupational Therapy Australia.

To meet current and future demands and enable access to treatment that is safe, effective, and acceptable, a robust and sustainable mental health workforce is required. Factors reported to attract people to work within the mental health sector include aspiring to help others, having an interest in mental health and human behavior, the desire to make a difference and do something worthwhile, personal lived experience, recognition, and value of discipline-specific roles. However, despite the various reasons people enter the public mental health workforce, recruitment and retention continue to be ongoing challenges. To date, there has been limited investigation into understanding which factors are most relevant to the current Victorian workforce. Furthermore, a comparison to health care workers outside of mental health is also needed to better understand the specific needs of staff within the mental health sector. Objective: This study aims to explore factors related to attraction, recruitment, and retention of the public mental health workforce in Victoria, Australia. Methods: The study is a multisite, mixed methods cross-sectional study to be conducted at 4 public hospital services within Victoria, Australia: 2 in metropolitan and 2 in regional or rural locations. Current, previous, and nonmental health workers will be asked to complete a 20-25–minute web-based survey, which is developed based on previous research and offered participation in an optional 30-60–minute semistructured interview to examine personal experiences and perceptions. Both aspects of the project will examine factors related to attraction, recruitment, and retention in the public mental health workforce. Differences between groups (ie, current, past, and nonmental health workers), as well as location, discipline, and health setting will be examined. Regression analyses will be performed to determine the factors most strongly associated with retention (ie, job satisfaction) and turnover intention. Qualitative data will be transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed to identify common themes. Results: As of May 2023, we enrolled 539 participants in the web-based survey and 27 participants in the qualitative interview. Conclusions: This project seeks to build on current knowledge from within Australia and internationally to understand role and service/system-related issues of attraction, recruitment, and retention specifically within Victoria, Australia. Seeking up-to-date information from across the health workforce may provide factors specific to mental health by illuminating any differences between mental health workers and health care workers outside of mental health.

', 'Queen bee syndrome: A modern dilemma of working women and its effects on turnover intentions In modern business life, women cannot be adequately represented in business life, and in many cultures, male domination in the business environment continues without question. The negative impact of this male-dominated work environment on women may create expectations of solidarity among women workers and more supportive attitudes towards each other, but in practice these expectations may not always be met. Many women even claim that they are excluded or not supported and even prevented by working women managers. In queen bee syndrome, it was argued that female managers preferred to stay away from and support their female subordinates, in order to suppress the feelings of inadequacy and exclusion exposed on them by male employees because of their gender. Thus, it is argued that they believe that they will avoid being an ordinary member of their social group and try to create the perception that they do not have the characteristics of this disadvantaged group. However, their inclination to distance themselves from their subordinates often creates an unfavourable environment, which may lead to high levels of turnover intentions on the side of their subordinates.

Descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s alpha, Pearson and multiple regression analyses were used. Findings: The empirical analyses provided support to the multidimensionality of turnover. In addition, turnover was predicted by a model of eight factors (adjusted R2 = 0.456), namely, economic needs, quality of work life, leadership type and practices, social needs, marital status, organisational satisfaction, organisational commitment and public policy. Research limitations/implications: The study was rich, empirical data were gathered and analysed along with qualitative literature. Gender remains salient in organisations as human resource policies alone are incapable of retaining women in leadership. Limited sample size and convenience sampling method may limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Workplace conditions complement human resource policies; hence, the success of the latter relies on the success of the former. Economic incentives remain significant to motivating managers and retaining women in leadership jobs.

Introduction: Despite the plethora of research around the world on this topic, studies describing organizational politics in nursing remain underexplored. Methods: A cross-sectional research design was utilized in this study. One hundred sixty-six (166) nurses participated. Five standardized tools were used: the Job Satisfaction Index, the Job Stress Scale, the Burnout Measure Scale, the Turnover Intention Inventory Scale and the Perception of Organizational Politics Scale. Results: Nurses employed both in private and government-owned hospitals perceived moderate levels of organizational politics.

Frequency and associated factors of sick leave and intention to quit among nurses need to be examined to maintain healthcare. Methods: An online survey among nursing staff (N = 757) in German hospitals was conducted between May and July 2021. Sick leave days, intention to quit, working conditions, depression, anxiety and sleep disorder symptoms, effort-reward imbalance (ERI), COVID-19-related and sociode-mographic variables were measured. Regression analyses were performed. Results: The intention to quit was present in 18.9%. One third (32.5%) reported sick leave of ≥10 and 12.3% more than 25 days in 12 months. Significant predictors for ≥10 sick leave days were infection with SARS-CoV-2, a pre-existing illness, exhaustion, trust in colleagues and fear of becoming infected. Higher ERI reward levels, perception of sufficient staff and contact with infected patients were associated with lower odds for ≥10 sick leave days. Lower reward levels, having changed work departments during the pandemic, working part-time and higher depression levels significantly predicted turnover intention. Conclusion: Alarmingly, many nurses intend to quit working in healthcare. Perceived reward seems to buffer both sick leave and turnover intention. Enhancing protection from COVID-19 and reducing workload might also prevent sick leave. Depression prevention, improved change management and support of part-time workers could contribute to reducing turnover intention among nurses. © 2022 by the authors.

The present study aimed to identify the predictors of turnover intention based on psychosocial factors in nurses of Ardabil pre-hospital emergency and educational and medical centres during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design: The present descriptive-analytical study was conducted in June, 2020. Methods: A total of 479 nurses working in Ardabil pre-hospital emergency and educational and medical centres to fight COVID-19 were recruited for this study using the census method. Data were collected using the Demographic Information Questionnaire, Turnover Intention Questionnaire, Weiss & Marmar Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), General Health Questionnaire (12 C-GHQ) and Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ). Data were analysed with SPSSv.22 software using correlation, t test, analysis of variance, multiple regression and descriptive tests. Results: The mean turnover intention score of nurses was 41.73 with a standard deviation of 12.11. The results of correlation coefficient revealed a positive relationship between PTSD, general health, job demand and job strain with turnover intention (p\xa0≤.01) and a positive and significant relationship between social support and turnover intention (p\xa0≤.01). Multiple regression analysis showed that the variables of gender, marital status, work position, decision latitude, social support, job strain, general health and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were predictors of turnover intention.

This paper reports a study which aimed to: (1) investigate the relationship between nurses' commitment to the nursing profession and organization and their intention to leave; (2) investigate nurses' perceptions of the possibility of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome infection and its moderation of their commitment to the nursing profession and the organization and their consequent intentions to leave the profession and the organization following the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Background. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 resulted in a fatality rate of approximately 11%. Nurses in hospitals caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome maintained close contact with the infected patients. The high risk of infection and death associated with caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome had a great impact on nurse retention in hospitals. Nurse turnover in many countries where these outbreaks occurred has been high since the first outbreak occurred in March 2003. Methods. Three hundred and thirty nurses working at a Taiwan hospital during the time of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak completed the Meyer, Allen & Smith Organizational and Occupational Commitment Scales, Intention to Leave and Perceived Stress of Infection Scales between July and August 2003. Results. All three components of occupational and organizational commitments were negatively associated with nurses' intentions to leave the nursing profession and the organization. Nurses' perceptions of the possibility of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome infection through caring for these patients had a moderating effect on the relationship between commitment and the intention to leave. Conclusions. Perceived risk to life from infection has a possible influence on the commitment/intention-to-leave model in hospital nurses caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, and this information can inform hospital and nursing managers about nurse retention following a severe acute respiratory syn drome outbreak and the management of commitment in the context of nursing human resources management. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Here we explore the combined impact of ethical climate and salespeople’s external WLOC on job meaningfulness. This study suggests that when salespeople perceive that their sales organization has a strong ethical climate, the negative impact of external WLOC is mitigated on key predictors of sales performance and turnover intentions. The following hypotheses were tested with a sample of 143 B2B salespeople from a sales organization based in the Southeastern USA: H1: External WLOC is negatively related to job meaningfulness.H2: Ethical climate is positively related to job meaningfulness.H3: Job meaningfulness is positively related to job performance.H4: Job meaningfulness is negatively related to turnover intentions.H5: Job performance is negatively related to turnover intentions.H6: Ethical climate moderates the impact of external WLOC on job meaningfulness. Results show an acceptable fit with the data and supported all hypotheses except for H5. The moderating hypothesis showed that ethical climate dampened the negative relationship between external WLOC and job meaningfulness. The study results contribute to the knowledge about ethical climate and external WLOC in important ways showing a negative relationship to job meaningfulness. The beneficial role played by firm’s ethical climate in shaping salesperson’s attitudes and behaviors is another contribution. The study highlights the need for sales managers to be aware of the potential negative impact of external WLOC during hiring and utilize the competitive advantage facilitated by firm’s ethical climate during training programs.

This specific job demand to express emotions not felt is peculiar in call centers, and can influence job satisfaction and turnover intentions, a crucial problem among these working contexts. This study aims to detect, within the theoretical framework of the Job Demands-Resources Model, the role of emotional dissonance (job demand), and two resources, job autonomy and supervisors’ support, in the perception of job satisfaction and turnover intentions among an Italian call center. Method The study involved 318 call center agents of an Italian Telecommunication Company. Data analysis first performed descriptive statistics through SPSS 22. A path analysis was then performed through LISREL 8.72 and tested both direct and indirect effects. Results Results suggest the role of resources in fostering job satisfaction and in decreasing turnover intentions. Emotional dissonance reveals a negative relation with job satisfaction and a positive relation with turnover. Moreover, job satisfaction is negatively related with turnover and mediates the relationship between job resources and turnover.

', 'The moderating roles of organizational commitment on the relationship between quality of work life and turnover intention among call center employees In recent years, employees’ turnover is a major concern for many organizations especially those that provide call centers. This is due to the fact that turnover among employees will resemble that something is not right about that organization and may cause the reputation of that company. In addition, it will incur both direct and indirect costs to hire new employees. Turnover is eminent among all center employees because of the stressful working conditions at the call centers. The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of quality of work life (QWL) variables, which include general well-being, control at work, home-work interface, job career satisfaction, stress at work and working conditions towards employee turnover intention. It also sought to investigate the moderating roles of organizational commitment towards the relationship between QWL and turnover intention. The research was conducted among call center employees at two major companies which were Digi Telecommunications and Xerox Business Services Malaysia. The quantitative research method was used and data were collected using questionnaires. Respondents were selected using convenience sampling and data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, regression and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The findings of this study revealed organizational commitment did not moderate the relationship between quality of work life and turnover intention among call center employees. However, all sub-variables of organizational commitment (affective, normative and continuance) did moderate one element in quality of life which was stress at work towards turnover intention. In addition, the researchers also found that only stress at work influenced employee turnover intention. It is recommended that employers to manage stress among employees at call centers by giving them better benefits to reduce turnover and to reward them with non-intrinsic compensation to keep them happy at the workplace. © 2020, Malaysian Consumer and Family Economics Association.

Findings: The analysis showed that abusive supervision predicts subordinates’ turnover intentions both directly and indirectly via job dissatisfaction. Moreover, continuance commitment was considered to be a boundary condition such that the mediated link was weaker when higher levels of continuance commitment were present. Practical implications: This study explains how and when abusive supervision leads to turnover intentions in the hospitality industry. This study also helps hospitality managers to understand the abusive supervision prevalence and provide interventions that can reduce detrimental effects of abusive supervision in hospitality organizations. Originality/value: Prior research examining the influence of supervisor abuse in hospitality organizations was scant. To bridge this noteworthy gap, this study examined the influence of abusive supervision in Chinese hospitality organizations.

The role of organizational identification Recognizing the importance of postmerger integration from a human resource management perspective, this study explores the relationship between employee perceptions of relative deprivation during a merger and acquisition (M&A) process and their turnover intentions. Drawing on social identity theory, we investigate whether the relationship between relative deprivation and turnover intention can be mediated by employee organizational identification. The results, based on a two-phase survey of 222 employees in a merged Korean company, show that egoistic relative deprivation, defined as people's feelings of deprivation due to their dissatisfaction with their position as an individual, predicts employee turnover intention. Moreover, employee identification with the postmerger organization was found to fully mediate the relationship between egoistic relative deprivation and turnover intention.

In this study, we shift the conversation to instead address the question: for whom are certain socialization tactics more or less beneficial? Whereas institutionalized socialization tactics provide considerable structure intended to reduce uncertainty and help newcomers adjust, less is known about whether and how individual psychological differences cause some newcomers to react differently to the same socialization tactics. To examine the interplay between organizational socialization efforts and newcomer individual differences, we hypothesize that newcomers’ work locus of control moderates the relationship between socialization tactics and voluntary turnover. We also examine the indirect role of newcomer work adjustment—role clarity, work mastery, social integration—and job embeddedness in transmitting the interaction between socialization tactics and work locus of control to turnover. Data collected from 676 newcomers at four time points over 12 months in various organizations provided general support for our hypotheses: newcomers with an external work locus of control showed higher social integration and embeddedness and lower turnover under institutionalized socialization tactics, but lower social integration and embeddedness and higher turnover under individualized tactics. Their turnover was also reduced (about nine times) from individualized to institutionalized tactics. In contrast, newcomers with an internal work locus of control were less influenced by either socialization tactic approach in terms of their social integration, embeddedness, or turnover. © The Author(s) 2021. job embeddedness; newcomer socialization tactics; voluntary turnover; work adjustment; work locus of control']"

With this requirement as a formal system in the company, management control systems are functioning to control a wide range of business activities, and it can be used to influence the behavior of managers. Organizational citizenship will encourage managers to do more business and in turn organizational citizenship is expected to reduce negative behaviors of employees such as turnover intention. This study examines: (1) the influence of organizational citizenship, 2) the role of organizational citizenship on turnover intention; and 3) the role of organizational citizenship as a mediating variable in the relationship between management control systems and turnover intention.

This behavior improves organizational performance and is something that all organizations and leaders welcome from their employees. However, when a supervisor asks subordinates for organizational citizenship behavior, employees may often feel resentful as their discretion has been removed. This is known as involuntary citizenship behavior, the situation where employees are forced or coerced to perform tasks beyond their contractual obligations that benefit the organization.This study explains the negative effects of involuntary citizenship behavior. Organizational citizenship behavior is demonstrated when people are satisfied with the present situation. However, involuntary citizenship behavior is related to dissatisfaction or stress.

However, few studies have been carried out on Nigerian employees’ perspectives on CSR and on how CSR affects their attitudes and behaviors at work. The present study sought to contribute to narrowing this gap by examining how CSR perceptions, work engagement, and turnover intention are related in a sample of Nigerian workers. More specifically, this study had triple aims: first, describe employees’ perceptions of their employers’ involvement in different CSR domains; second, examine how CSR perceptions were related to employees’ levels of work engagement and turnover intention; third, analyze work engagement intervention as a mediator in the relationship between CSR perceptions and turnover intention. The sample included 118 employees from different organizations who voluntarily participated in an online survey. The findings revealed that respondents consider that their employer organizations have relatively high involvement in CSR activities, especially activities towards customers, employees, and stockholders. Findings also revealed that employees’ perceptions of CSR are related to diminishing levels of turnover intention, via increased work engagement.

Donations to nonprofit organizations that fight poverty or protect the environment demonstrate support of a firm’s external stakeholders. Customers are increasingly interested in how firms support their internal stakeholders (i.e., employees), yet many firms are lagging on such CSR activities. Understanding employees as internal customer of firms’ CSR investments is critical as they play a decisive role in extracting value from a firm’s CSR activities (Korschun, Bhattacharya and Swain 2014; Rupp et al. 2013; Vlachos, Theotokis and Panagopoulos 2010) and represent an essential mediator between CSR and financial performance (Peloza 2009; Surroca, Tribo and Waddock 2010). Dissatisfied employees might negatively impact other stakeholder groups such as customers (e.g., Lings and Greenley 2005), for whom they are a highly credible source of CSR information (Dawkins 2004; Morsing, Schultz and Nielsen 2008). In other words, employees’ hypocrisy perceptions evoked by an imbalanced CSR portfolio might make or break a CSR strategy. Taking a portfolio perspective informed by stakeholder theory, our research is the first to explore the impact of CSR portfolio imbalances, i.e., larger company-external than internal CSR efforts. Two studies demonstrate the detrimental effects of such imbalances on company-internal stakeholders, i.e., employees. Study 1 utilizes a multisource secondary dataset (n = 1902) and shows that imbalanced CSR portfolios significantly increase objective employee turnover at the organizational level. Study 2 employs a cross-industry employee survey (n = 3110) to demonstrate that imbalanced CSR portfolios evoke employees’ corporate hypocrisy perceptions and thereby promote emotional exhaustion and intention-to-quit. Both studies point to the crucial importance of taking a holistic approach to manage CSR portfolios, taking into account and balancing external and internal CSR customers.References available upon request. © 2016, Academy of Marketing Science.

Alongside workplace bullying, PSC is structurally related to psychosocial health outcomes acting through the demands and resources in the work environment. Consistent with both PSC theory and the theory of social exchange, this multi-level study found that workplace bullying mediated the relationship between PSC and psychological distress and intention to quit the organization.

The current study explores the victims’ experiences from an interpretive perspective in the context of Information Technology organizations in India. The qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews with the victims of workplace bullying. The analysis using grounded theory approach resulted in a conceptual model, which explains the antecedents, bullying behaviours, consequences, and self-coping methods of the victims. Job demands, leadership and management styles of the supervisor, and interpersonal conflict emerged as the major antecedents of workplace bullying. The victims’ inability to adapt to changes was found as a personality factor that stimulated workplace bullying in the presence of other antecedents. The study reveals that although the victims experienced negative bullying behaviours in their daily life, most of them were unaware of the phenomenon. Some of the new bullying behaviours identified from the current study are taking ownership of others’work without giving due credit, grabbing others’ challenging assignments, and repeated borrowing of money without returning. The victims experienced various negative emotions as the initial reaction to bullying behaviours. As the bullying behaviours prolonged, the participants experienced various personal and work-related consequences. The self-coping mechanisms identified in the study were sharing emotional experiences with friends and family, having an easy-going attitude, voicing the issues, and perceived organizational support (POS). POS was considered to be important for having an influence on employee turnover intention and organizational commitment. Based on the POS, three categories of victims were identified – Leavers, Survivors, and Loyals.

Design: A cross-sectional multicentre study with convenience sampling was conducted. We have complied with the guidelines of STROBE Checklist in presenting this research. Methods: Out of 900 questionnaires, 696 were deemed valid for analysis (77.33%). This study collected data on sociodemographic information, experiences of workplace violence, professional commitment, work excitement, violence prevention climate and turnover intention. Results: The results show that professional commitment has a significant effect on turnover intention. Professional commitment positively influences work excitement, especially when the work is challenging and varied. It also indirectly influences turnover intention by generating work excitement. Workplace violence introduces an interactive moderating effect on the relationship between professional commitment and work excitement. A violence prevention climate changes the interactive moderating effect of workplace violence on professional commitment, which in turn influences turnover intention. Conclusions: Positive work experience, institutional organisational policies and support systems are the mediating and moderating factors in the relationship between professional commitment and turnover intention.

Aims and objectives: The aim of this study was to test the adequacy of the Competence-Turnover Intention Model, which was developed to identify how nursing competence could affect nurses' turnover intention (nurses' intention to voluntarily leave an organisation). Background: Recent studies have suggested that the level of nursing competence is negatively related to nurses' intention to leave their jobs, suggesting that a lack of competence threatens both the quality and quantity of the nursing workforce. However, the mechanism of how nursing competence affects nurses' turnover intention has not been explored previously. Design: A cross-sectional survey design was used. Methods: Surveys were distributed to 1337 Japanese registered nurses/midwives in October, 2013. The adequacy of the model was analysed using structural equation modelling. Results: In total, 766 questionnaires were returned, with a return rate of 57%. The model fitted well with the data. The results showed that the level of nursing competence was related positively to the quantity of organisational rewards they felt they had received, and negatively related to the level of exhaustion they experienced. Moreover, the perceived organisational rewards and exhaustion were correlated with nurses' turnover intention through affective commitment. Conclusions: The Competence-Turnover Intention Model is useful for explaining how nursing competence impacts on their turnover intention. Relevance to clinical practice: Clinical implications derived from the findings are that: promoting nursing competence is key to improving not only the quality of care provided by nurses, but also to retaining the nursing workforce, and the model can be used to develop strategies that would mitigate their turnover intention. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Background: There is a severe shortage of nurses worldwide. Research is needed to understand how nurses' intention to leave hospitals and the nursing profession can be alleviated. Methods: This study adopted a cross-sectional design and a survey method. Proportionate random sampling was used to ensure sample representativeness. This study surveyed 430 registered nurses in a medical centre in Taiwan between December 2021 and January 2022. We used Turnover Scale and Self-Efficacy Scale and developed Having a Place Scale. Results: Psychological ownership comprises three dimensions: self-efficacy, nurse identity and ‘having a place’ in the nursing profession. This research is the first to examine how these three dimensions of psychological ownership of the nursing profession are related to the intention to leave a hospital or the nursing profession. Self-efficacy and ‘having a place’ are negatively related to nurses' intention to leave a hospital (r = −.23 and −.31, p <.001). Nurse identity is negatively related to nurses' intention to leave the nursing profession (r = −.38, p <.001). Intention to leave a hospital is positively related to nurses' intention to leave the profession (r =.76, p <.001). Conclusion: The findings provide novel insights for retaining nurses. Nurse managers could use strategies such as including nurses in making workplace decisions and encouraging them to personalize their workspace. Implications for Nursing Management: Nurse managers can enhance nurses' self-efficacy and sense of ‘having a place’ to retain nurses in hospitals, while enhancing nurse identity to retain nurses in the profession. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. nurse; psychological ownership; structural equation modeling; survey; turnover intention; workforce"", ""The mediating effect of job motivation on the relationship between career barriers and nurses’ turnover intention Background: Numerous organisational variables have been shown to be associated with nurse turnover, and evidence of the negative impact of nurse turnover on patients and healthcare organisations is accumulating. However, little is known about the impact of nurses' career barriers on nurses’ turnover intentions. Aim: This study aimed to examine the effect of variables related to nurses’ sociodemographic and working characteristics, career barriers, and work motivation on turnover intentions, and reveal the mediating effect of job motivation on the relationship between career barriers on turnover intentions. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire distributed among nurses working in university, private, and public hospitals in Turkey. The sample of the study consisted of 404 nurses, and the Demographic and Work-Related Variables Questionnaire, Career Barriers in Nursing Scale, Nurses Job Motivation Scale, and the Turnover Intention Scale were used for data collection. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation analysis, multiple-regression analysis, and mediating effect analysis with HAYES (Model 4) were used in data analysis. Findings: The regression analysis determined that seven independent variables (type of hospital, duration of current hospital experience, choosing the profession willingly, satisfaction with career opportunities in the current hospital, having a career goal, career barriers, and job motivation) affected nurses’ turnover intention, and these variables explained 41% of the total variance. It was also found that job motivation has a mediating effect on the relationship between career barriers and turnover intention. Conclusion: This study found that nurses’ turnover intentions were affected by variables such as career barriers, job motivation, and sociodemographic/working characteristics, with job motivation having a mediating effect on the relationship between career barriers and turnover intention. An additional finding was that as job motivation increases, turnover intention caused by career barriers decreases. It is important that managers and policymakers implement practices aimed at reducing career barriers and study the factors that increase nurses’ job motivation in order to maintain nurse retention. © 2023 Australian College of Nursing Ltd Career barriers; Job motivation; Nursing; Turnover intentions""]"

Turnover Intention and Parental Correctional Career Endorsement among Correctional Officers in Taiwan Correction officers play an important role in the functioning of any correctional facility and in the criminal justice system overall. A substantial and growing literature exists on turnover and turnover intention of correctional officers in Western societies. Since the societal culture and working environments of correctional facilities are notably different in Taiwan from those of the West, turnover intentions may arise from different sources and result in different consequences. Likewise, parental opinions likely play a more important role in children’s job selection in Taiwan than in non-Western societies. This study examines the factors affecting correctional officers’ turnover intentions and their likelihood of parental endorsement of a correction career among Taiwanese correctional officers.

The objective of this study was to compare the job satisfaction and intention to leave of different categories of health workers in Tanzania, Malawi, and South Africa. We undertook a cross-sectional survey of a stratified cluster sample of 2,220 health workers, 564 from Tanzania, 939 from Malawi, and 717 from South Africa. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire, which included demographic information, a 10-item job satisfaction scale, and one question on intention to leave. Multiple regression was used to identify significant predictors of job satisfaction and intention to leave. There were statistically significant differences in job satisfaction and intention to leave between the three countries. Approximately 52.1% of health workers in South Africa were satisfied with their jobs compared to 71% from Malawi and 82.6% from Tanzania (χ2=140.3, p<0.001). 18.8% of health workers in Tanzania and 26.5% in Malawi indicated that they were actively seeking employment elsewhere, compared to 41.4% in South Africa (χ2=83.5, p<0.001). The country differences were confirmed by multiple regression. The study also confirmed that job satisfaction is statistically related to intention to leave. We have shown differences in the levels of job satisfaction and intention to leave between different groups of health workers from Tanzania, Malawi, and South Africa. Our results caution against generalising about the effectiveness of interventions in different contexts and highlight the need for less standardised and more targeted HRH strategies than has been practised to date. ', 'Attrition of health extension workers in Ethiopia: trends, regional variations and determinants – a mixed methods study of 15 years of experience Background: Ensuring regular supervision, capacity building and motivation are crucial for the successful retention of health extension workers (HEWs). Failure in these aspects could increase the attrition rate of HEWs. To date, there has not been a comprehensive nationwide study on HEW attrition that could act as a source of evidence for policy makers. This study explored HEW attrition, including leaving the health sector entirely and its regional variation, trends and predictors of attrition out of the health system. Methods: This study explored the attrition of HEWs from the beginning of the program until the end of 2018. A district-based mixed method study was conducted to review the personnel files of HEWs. A multistage sampling technique was employed to select 3,476 HEWs, and a probability weight was assigned for each observation. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the outcome and predictor variables. A logistic regression model was used to model attrition out of the health system. A qualitative study was conducted to understand the reasons why HEWs leave their jobs. Thematic analysis was performed using Nvivo version 12. Results: The magnitude of attrition of HEWs was found to be 21.1% during the fifteen years of HEP implementation. Of the total 704 who left their job as an HEW, 530 (73%) left the health system altogether. Number of biological children [AOR = 0.61, 95% CI; 0.42–0.89], having an additional education [AOR = 8.34, 95% CI; 3.67–18.98], obtaining official recognition [AOR = 0.29, 95% CI; 0.10–0.83], administrative reprimand [AOR = 1.66, 95% CI; 1.07 -2. 56), distance between district health office and health post [AOR = 1.75, 95%CI; 1.18–2.59) and COC status [AOR = 2.06, 95%CI 1.39–3.06) were independent predictors of leaving the health sector. High regional variation in attrition was observed, ranging from 38.5% in Addis Ababa to just 6.1% in the Harari region. The trend of attrition has steadily increased over time, with a high of 1,999 attritions per 10,000 HEW in 2018. Psychosocial factors, administrative issues, career advancement incentives, and workplace-related problems were the themes that emerged from the qualitative study as reasons for attrition of HEWs. Conclusion: Even though the magnitude of attrition was relatively low, there was high regional variation and incremental trends. Moreover, the out-of-health sector attrition is also high. Critically examining the HEP policy environment to increase the number of HEWs deployed per health post to reduce workload and improving HEW incentives, including career development, may assist in increasing HEW job satisfaction, which in turn could help to reduce attrition, including leaving the health sector. © 2023, The Author(s). Attrition; Ethiopia; Health extension workers; Regional variation; Trend', 'Understanding the factors affecting attrition and intention to leave of health extension workers: a mixed methods study in Ethiopia Background: The Health Extension Program (HEP) is Ethiopia’s flagship community health program, launched in 2003. Health Extension Workers (HEWs) are key vehicles for the delivery of the HEP. While it is believed that there is high attrition among HEWs, the magnitude of or reasons for attrition is unknown. Their intention to leave their jobs in the next 5 years has also never been investigated on a national scale. This study aimed to assess the magnitude of, and factors affecting HEWs’ attrition and intention to leave in Ethiopia. Methods: The study used mixed methods to address the research objectives. Using stratified random sampling and regions as strata, 85 districts from nine regions were randomly selected in Ethiopia. Within each study district, six kebeles (village clusters) were randomly selected, and all HEWs working in these kebeles were interviewed to capture their 5-year intention to leave. The study team developed a data-extraction tool for a rapid review of district-level documents covering the period June 30, 2004 through June 30, 2019 to gather their attrition figures. We used survival analysis to model attrition data and checked model goodness-of-fit using the Cox–Snell residual test. We additionally collected qualitative data from HEWs who had left their positions. Results: The attrition of HEWS over the lifespan of the HEP was 21.1% (95% CI 17.5–25.3%), and the median time to exit from HEWs workforce was 5.8\xa0years. The incidence rate was 3.1% [95% CI 2.8–3.4]. The risk of attrition was lower amongst HEWs with level four certifications, with children, and among those working in urban settings. By contrast, HEWs who were not certified with a certificate of competency (COC), who were deployed after 2008, and those who were diploma/degree holders were more likely to exit the HEWs workforce. The magnitude of intention to leave was 39.5% (95% CI 32.5–47%) and the primary reasons to leave were low incentives, dearth of career development opportunities (50.8%), high workload (24.2%), and other psychosocial factors (25%). Conclusion: Although the magnitude of attrition is not worryingly high, we see high magnitude in HEWs’ intention to leave, indicating a dissatisfied workforce. Multiple factors have contributed to attrition and intention to leave, the prevalence of many of which can be reduced to fit the needs of this workforce and to retain them for the sustained delivery of primary healthcare in the country. Ensuring HEWs’ job satisfaction is important and linked with their career development and potentially higher rates of retention. © 2022, The Author(s).

Awards; Customer service; Empowerment; Hospitality industry; Involvement; Training"", 'United States secret service: An agency in crisis The United States Secret Service (USSS) is tasked with a zero-failure mission: to protect the President and other protectees at all costs. For most of its existence, USSS has strived to complete that mission while simultaneously garnering the respect and admiration of the American people. Secret Service agents and officers earned a reputation as stoic and impervious guardians of our government’s most important leaders. The American public’s respect for the agency diminished following the April 2012 prostitution scandal in Cartagena, Colombia, which attracted significant media attention and exposed systemic problems within the agency. Since then, several incidents have made it abundantly clear that USSS is in crisis. The agency’s weaknesses have been exposed by a series of security failures at the White House, during presidential visits, and at the residences of other officials, including Vice President Biden and former presidents of the United States. The Committee’s investigation found that problems that undermine USSS’s protective mission predate and postdate the misconduct in Cartagena. The Committee also found that at times agency leaders have provided incomplete and inaccurate information to Congress. This report examines four incidents in detail: a November 11, 2011, incident where an individual fired several shots at the White House from a semiautomatic rifle; the April 2012 misconduct in Cartagena, Colombia; a September 16, 2014, incident at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, where an armed contract security guard with a violent arrest history rode in an elevator with President Obama and later breached the President’s security formation; and a March 4, 2015, incident where two intoxicated senior USSS officials- including a top official on the President’s protective detail-interfered with a crime scene involving a bomb threat just outside the White House grounds. The Committee also found that one year after the blue-ribbon Protective Mission Panel issued its assessment and recommendations for the security of the White House compound, several serious deficiencies remain. As USSS’s mission has grown, its workforce has had to do more with less. USSS is experiencing a staffing crisis that poses perhaps the greatest threat to the agency. The crisis began after 2011 when the number of employees began to decline sharply, and the decline continued across all categories of employment. Three main causes are significant cuts imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, systemic mismanagement at USSS that has been unable to correct these shortfalls, and declining employee morale leading to attrition. From budget-related hiring freezes to increasing attrition over the past five years, the personnel shortage is so high that-notwithstanding the blue-ribbon Protective Mission Panel’s recommendations that USSS increase hiring significantly-there has been a net decline in operational personnel, including the Uniformed Division that guards the White House. The high attrition rate means that the personnel who remain are significantly overworked, and morale is at an all-time low. Rather than swiftly bringing on new employees, USSS has an extraordinarily inefficient hiring process which overburdens USSS with low-quality applicants. Further, recent changes to the process have allegedly fostered risks in connection with the approval of security clearances. Internal USSS data shows that morale is further harmed because many employees do not have confidence in agency leadership. Some whistleblowers told the Committee they believed this was due to a culture where leaders are not held accountable. Many agency personnel who spoke to the Committee are desperate for new outside leadership willing to undertake dramatic reforms at the agency. The Committee found that reforms should include a reconsideration of USSS’s responsibilities, which have dramatically expanded in recent decades. No peripheral investigative duties should be allowed to detract from the core aspect of USSS’s mission: protection. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. ', 'The Power of Linkedln: Will IT professionals leave their organization for professional advancement due to participating Linkedln? This proposal explores a common phenomenon of turnover intention - intention to leave an organization for professional advancement (ILPA). Nowadays, Linkedln provides a good platform for professionals to get connected, to share their experience in career development and to seek jobs. Based on self-determination theory, we would like to investigate how participating in Linkedln influences ILPA. In our theoretical framework, we first argue that professionals would receive autonomy, competence and relatedness supports for career development from participating in Linkedln. Second, these three essential supports for career development would drive the autonomous and controlled motivations for participating in Linkedln. Third, we hypothesize that the autonomous motivations for participating in Linkedln have a positive influence on both affective professional commitment and normative professional commitment. Moreover, the controlled motivations for participating in Linkedln have positive influence on continuous professional commitment. Fourth, the influence of autonomous and controlled motivations on the three dimensions of professional commitment will be mediated by actual use of Linkedln. Fifth, these three dimensions of professional commitment have a positive influence on ILPA. Control factors such as organizational commitment, professional tenure, organizational tenure and biographic profile will be surveyed. This study will contribute to the literature on two untapped areas - 1) to what extent social media influence professional commitment and ILPA, and 2) how SDT can explain why people are so involved with Linkedln. Hence, this study will shed light on turnover intention and SDT from a new perspective. Moreover, the extent to which participating in Linkedln influences ILPA will be examined in the context of IT professionals in Hong Kong. Last, the findings of this study will draw the attention of companies in setting their policies for retaining IT professionals. The target population of this study will be those Hong Kong IT professionals, who are active participants in Linkedln. Using an online survey, participants will be invited by emails posted to their Linkedln discussion groups such as the ""Hong Kong IT Professionals Association."" Reminders will be sent, and we expect a response rate of around 20%. To control for common method bias, we will collect the data in three waves. The first wave will involve constructs related to the supports and motivations for participating in Linkedln as a career development tool. The second wave is to collect use data such as number of existing connections, and the third wave will be on constructs related to commitments and ILPA.

Background: Throughout China, a growing number of physicians are leaving or intending to depart from their organizations owing to job dissatisfaction. Little information is available about the role of occupational burnout in this association. We set out to analyze the relationship between job satisfaction, burnout, and turnover intention, and further to determine whether occupational burnout can serve as a mediator among Chinese physicians from urban state-owned medical institutions. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in March 2010 in Hubei Province, central China. The questionnaires assessed sociodemographic characteristics, job satisfaction, burnout, and turnover intention. The job satisfaction and occupational burnout instruments were obtained by modifying the Chinese Physicians' Job Satisfaction Questionnaire (CPJSQ) and the Chinese Maslach Burnout Inventory (CMBI), respectively. Such statistical methods as one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, GLM-univariate and structural equation modeling were used. Results: Of the 1600 physicians surveyed, 1451 provided valid responses. The respondents had medium scores (3.18 +/-0.73) on turnover intention, in which there was significant difference among the groups from three urban areas with different development levels. Turnover intention, which significantly and negatively related to all job-satisfaction subscales, positively related to each subscale of burnout syndrome. Work environment satisfaction (b = -0.074, p &lt; 0.01), job rewards satisfaction (b = -0.073, p &lt; 0.01), organizational management satisfaction (b = -0.146, p &lt; 0.01), and emotional exhaustion (b = 0.135, p &lt; 0.01) were identified as significant direct predictors of the turnover intention of physicians, with 41.2% of the variance explained unitedly, under the control of sociodemographic variables, among which gender, age, and years of service were always significant. However, job-itself satisfaction no longer became significant, with the estimated parameter on job rewards satisfaction smaller after burnout syndrome variables were included. As congregated latent concepts, job satisfaction had both significant direct effects (gamma21= -0.32, p &lt; 0.01) and indirect effects (gamma11× beta21= -0.13, p &lt; 0.01) through occupational burnout (62% explained) as a mediator on turnover intention (47% explained). Conclusions: Our study reveals that several, but not all dimensions of both job satisfaction and burnout syndrome are relevant factors affecting physicians' turnover intention, and there may be partial mediation effects of occupational burnout, mainly through emotional exhaustion, within the impact of job satisfaction on turnover intention. This suggests that enhancements in job satisfaction can be expected to reduce physicians' intentions to quit by the intermediary role of burnout as well as the direct path. It is hoped that these findings will offer some clues for health-sector managers to keep their physician resource motivated and stable. © 2011 Zhang and Feng; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. "", ""Job satisfaction, burnout, and turnover intention among primary care providers in rural China: Results from structural equation modeling Background: Low job satisfaction, severe burnout and high turnover intention are found to be prevalent among the primary care providers (PCPs) in township health centers (THCs), but their associations have received scant attention in the literature. In light of this, this study aims to examine the relationships between job satisfaction, burnout and turnover intention, and explore the predictors of turnover intention with a view to retaining PCPs in rural China. Methods: Using the multistage cluster sampling method, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in Shandong Province, China. 1148 PCPs from 47 THCs participated in this study. Job satisfaction, burnout and turnover intention were measured with a multifaceted instrument developed based on the existing literature, the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the participants' responses to a Likert item drawn from the literature, respectively. The relationships of the three factors were examined using Pearson correlation and structural equation modeling, while the predictors of turnover intention were investigated using multivariate logistic regression. Results: The subscale that the PCPs were most dissatisfied with was job rewards (95.12%), followed by working environment (49.65%) and organizational management (47.98%). The percentages of the PCPs reporting high-levels of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment were 27.66, 6.06, and 38.74%, respectively. About 14.06% of the respondents had high turnover intention. There was a significant direct effect of job satisfaction on burnout (γ=-0.52) and turnover intention (γ=-0.29), a significant direct effect of burnout on turnover intention (γ= 0.28), and a significant indirect effect (γ=-0.14) of job satisfaction on turnover intention through burnout as a mediator. Work environment satisfaction, medical practicing environment satisfaction, and organizational management satisfaction proved to be negative predictors of turnover intention (p < 0.05), whereas reduced personal accomplishment was identified as a positive predictor (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Plagued by low job satisfaction and severe burnout, the PCPs in rural China may have high turnover intentions. Job satisfaction had not only negative direct effects on burnout and turnover intention, but also an indirect effect on turnover intention through burnout as a mediator. Targeted strategies should be taken to motivate and retain the PCPs. © 2020 The Author(s).

Since 2009, China has implemented a new series of medical system reforms and the shortage and loss of primary medical staff have been alleviated accordingly. However, China has a large population and it is difficult to distribute health human resources evenly across regions. This study aimed to explore the current status of turnover intention and its relationship with psychological capital, social support, and job burnout, as well as how these factors influence turnover intention of primary medical staff in Anhui province, China. Methods: Using structured questionnaires to collect data, including demographic characteristics, turnover intention, psychological capital, social support, and Chinese Maslach Burnout Inventory scale. A total of 1152 primary medical workers of Anhui were investigated. Data were analyzed by t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression model. Results: Total scores of turnover intention, psychological capital, social support, and job burnout of subjects were 14.15 ± 4.35, 100.09 ± 15.98, 64.93 ± 13.23 and 41.07 ± 9.437, respectively. Multiple linear regression showed the related factors of turnover intention were age, job position, work unit, and scores of job burnout. Pearson correlation showed psychological capital and social support were negatively correlated with turnover intention, while the score of job burnout was positively correlated with turnover intention. Conclusion: The improvement of psychological capital and social support and the reduction of job burnout may play an important role in reducing turnover intention of primary medical staff. Primary medical managers should strengthen the humanistic care for primary medical staff, optimize the incentive mechanism, and improve internal management of medical institutions for stability. © 2021, The Author(s).

They largely impede the sustainable development of preschool education. This study aimed to explore the level of perceptions of pay equity among preschool teachers and examine the relationships among pay equity, turnover intention, perceived organizational support (POS), and job satisfaction. A survey was conducted with 2029 preschool teachers from Chinese public kindergartens, and descriptive analysis and covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) were used to analyze the data. The results showed that the level of pay equity for preschool teachers was moderate, with a significant difference between teachers with Bianzhi and those without. The structural equation model revealed a significant negative relationship between teachers’ pay equity and their intent to leave. Perceived organizational support and job satisfaction independently mediated the relationship between pay equity and turnover intention, with a serial mediation effect observed. These findings highlight the importance of considering teachers’ pay equity, POS, and job satisfaction in order to retain high-quality teachers. © 2023 by the authors. pay equity; perceived organizational support; preschool teachers; teacher retention; turnover intention', ""Should i stay or Should i GO? Physical education teachers' Career intentions Purpose: This study investigated Finnish physical education (PE) teachers' intentions to leave the profession and the reasons behind them. Method: A large sample (N = 808) of PE teachers who graduated between 1980 and 2008 (432 women, 376 men) answered a modified job satisfaction and teacher follow-up questionnaire that elicited career perceptions, intentions, and current work duties. Results: In this sample, 26% of the respondents were contemplating leaving their jobs as PE teachers and an additional 13% were actually in the process of transferring from PE teaching but planned to remain in school teaching. To determine the reasons for considering leaving the PE teaching profession, principal axis factoring with direct oblimin rotation was performed on the 35 items of the questionnaire. These factors were labeled as status of the PE teaching profession, pupils, working conditions, colleagues, expertise, workload, administration, and stress. The most influential factors were poor facilities, poor equipment, and isolation from the peers. Additional factors included working conditions, low status of the PE teachers, and workload. For women, workload and stress were more significant reasons for leaving the profession than they were for men (p =.010-.040, d = 0.34-0.43). PE teachers in the age group of 40 to 44 years old constituted the largest group who were considering leaving the profession. Conclusion: Thirty-nine percent of the PE teachers considered leaving the profession. Even though PE teachers face a variety of challenges in their work, the majority intend to remain in the teaching profession.

Over the past few decades, researchers in general education and special education have investigated the various reasons why new teachers leave the field and ways in which they can be better supported to stay in their positions. Despite the increased focus on why new special education teachers leave the field, the knowledge related to teacher attrition in special education is still somewhat limited when compared with the field of general education. For example, previous research has heavily relied on survey research to understand teacher attrition, but these methods may limit some of the important information related to the complexity of why a teacher might leave the field or their job within the first few years.

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to identity specific factors that contribute to dental hygienists remaining in the same private practice employment setting for five or more years. Working conditions, the employer and the organizational structure of the employment setting, scope of practice, and personal factors were assessed. METHODS: In 1992, a self-designed questionnaire was sent to a sample of 1,200 licensed dental hygienists. One state was randomly chosen from each of the 12 American Dental Hygienists' Association (ADHA) regions of the United States, and 100 licensed dental hygienists were randomly selected from each of these twelve states. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis (frequency distribution) and multivariate analyses (factor analyses). RESULTS: A 62.9% (n = 755) response rate was obtained from the 1200 questionnaires mailed. Of those dental hygienists, 14.3% (n = 108) were not practicing, and 85.7% (n = 647) were currently practicing. Nearly two-thirds (63.3%; n = 480) of the total number of respondents had been practicing five or more years in the same practice setting. Six major factors were identified by dental hygienists as reasons for remaining in one private practice setting for at least five years (1) quality/safe work environment, (2) time management for high-quality dental hygiene services, (3) effective employer office policies/procedures and personnel management, (4) employer support of professional career, (5) supportive work environment, and (6) variety in scope of practice. CONCLUSIONS: Factors identified in this study as influential in dental hygienists' retention in private practice are similar to those identified as reasons for leaving the profession in previous attrition and reentry studies. To increase retention and job satisfaction of dental hygienists in the private practice setting, strategies for effectively working with employers should be emphasized in dental hygiene and dental curriculums and in continuing education programs.

Objectives: We analyzed the extent to which the service recovery performance of frontline employees in private health care institutions is influenced by employee perceptions of manager attitudes toward service quality, workplace support, and manager fairness and organizational commitment. We also examined the relationship of service recovery performance to employee job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Methods: Partial least square path modeling of data from 178 frontline employees in private health care institutions in North Cyprus was utilized. Results: Although empowerment and role clarity were positively related to service recovery performance, perceived managerial attitudes toward hospital customer service, teamwork, and customer service-oriented training as indicators of workplace support were not related to frontline employees' service recovery performance. Organizational justice was related to affective commitment, which in turn was related to service recovery performance. Although service recovery performance was not related to employee turnover intentions, it was related to job satisfaction. Conclusion: Managerial implications of these study findings are presented in the light of the cognitive evaluation theory. Health services differ from other service organizations in the way that intrinsic and extrinsic rewards influence the service recovery efforts of frontline employees.

However, the question of howto enhance employee CO is a tricky one. It has been stated that employee CO is a stable work value or disposition that is consistent over time, and therefore, difficult to manage. However, one factor that might be an important driver of employee CO is the retailers’ ethical leadership behaviour. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to focus on exploring the links between retailers’ ethical leadership, frontline employee CO and frontline employee job satisfaction, job-related stress and turnover intentions. Design/methodology/approach – For the purpose of this study, the authors develop five hypotheses about the retailers’ ethical leadership, frontline employee CO and frontline employee job satisfaction, job-related stress and turnover intentions. Using structural equation modelling, the authors test the hypotheses using a sample of 208 respondents from the Finnish retail industry. Findings – As a first important contribution, the findings of the present study indicate that frontline employee perceptions of their retailer’s ethical leadership are strongly linked to employee CO. As a second contribution, our results suggest that employee CO is positively related to job satisfaction. As a third contribution, this study shows that frontline employee job satisfaction is negatively related to their turnover intentions.

Background: Nurses' practice environments in general hospitals have been extensively investigated. Potential variations across practice settings, for instance in psychiatric hospitals, have been much less studied. Design: A cross-sectional design with a survey. Method: A structural equation model previously tested in acute hospitals was evaluated using survey data from a sample of 357 registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and non-registered caregivers from two psychiatric hospitals in Belgium between December 2010-April 2011. The model included paths between practice environment dimensions and outcome variables, with burnout in a mediating position. A workload measure was also tested as a potential mediator between the practice environment and outcome variables. Results: An improved model, slightly modified from the one validated earlier in samples of acute care nurses, was confirmed. This model explained 50% and 38% of the variance in job outcomes and nurse-reported quality of care respectively. In addition, workload was found to play a mediating role in accounting for job outcomes and significantly improved a model that ultimately explained 60% of the variance in these variables. Conclusion: In psychiatric hospitals as in general hospitals, nurse-physician relationship and other organizational dimensions such as nursing and hospital management were closely associated with perceptions of workload and with burnout and job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and nurse-reported quality of care.

Background: Prior research has consistently demonstrated correlations between nurse practice environments and nurses' job satisfaction and health at work, but somewhat less evidence connects practice environments with patient outcomes. The relationship has also been more extensively documented using hospital-wide measures of environments as opposed to measures at the nursing unit level. Design: Survey. Method: Data from a sample of 546 staff nurses from 42 units in four Belgian hospitals were analysed using a two-level (nursing unit and nurse) random intercept model. Linear and generalised linear mixed effects models were fitted including nurse practice environment dimensions measured with the Revised Nursing Work Index and burnout dimensions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory as independent variables and job outcome and nurse-assessed quality of care variables as dependent variables. Results: Significant unit-level associations were found between nurse practice environment and burnout dimensions and job satisfaction, turnover intentions and nurse-reported quality of care. Emotional exhaustion is a predictor of job satisfaction, nurse turnover intentions and assessed quality of care as well besides various nurse work practice environment dimensions. Nurses 'ratings of unit-level management and hospital-level management and organisational support had effects in opposite directions on assessments of quality of care at the unit; this suggests that nurses' perceptions of conditions on their nursing units relative to their perceptions of their institutions at large are potentially influential in their overall job experience. Conclusion: Nursing unit variation of the nurse practice environment and feelings of burnout predicts job outcome and nurse-reported quality of care variables. Relevance to clinical practice: The team and environmental contexts of nursing practice play critical roles in the recruitment and retention of nurses, and as well as in the quality of care delivered.

The aim of the study was to investigate relationships between nurse practice environment, burnout, job outcomes and nurse-assessed quality of care. Background. A growing line of work confirms that, in countries with distinctly different healthcare systems, nurses report similar shortcomings in their work environments and the quality of care in hospitals. Neither the specific work environment factors most involved in dissatisfaction, burnout and other negative job outcomes, and patient outcomes, nor the mechanisms tying nurse job outcomes to quality of care are well understood. Method. A Nurse Practice Environment and Outcome causal structure involving pathways between practice environment dimensions and outcome variables with components of burnout in a mediating position was developed. Survey data from 401 staff nurses across 31 units in two hospitals (including the Revised Nursing Work Index, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and job outcome and nurse-assessed quality of care variables) were used to test this model using structural equation modelling techniques. The data were collected from December 2006 to January 2007. Results. Goodness of fit statistics confirmed an improved model with burnout dimensions in mediating positions between nurse practice environment dimensions and both job outcomes and nurse-assessed quality of care, explaining 20% and 46% of variation in these two indicators, respectively.

Specifically, it proposes that strong occupations restrict personality heterogeneity (defined as the extent to which there is variability in incumbents' personalities), which mediates the effect of occupational strength on work-related outcomes. Using a sample of 178,087 individuals employed in 315 occupations, the results indicate that strong occupations (operationalized as having high task significance) had advantageous effects on occupational satisfaction, tenure, and turnover intentions, and these effects were partially mediated by personality heterogeneity. Task significance had a negative effect on personality heterogeneity, and personality heterogeneity led to less favorable attitudes and behaviors. The occupational autonomy operationalization of situational strength also had advantageous effects on incumbents' occupational satisfaction, tenure, and turnover intentions, but these effects were not mediated by personality heterogeneity. In addition, personality distance (defined as the extent to which incumbents were personally different from others in the occupation) adversely affected within-occupation attitudes and behaviors.

It further investigates if reframing and altering the meaning of one’s work (i.e., cognitive job crafting) buffers the relationships between turnover intentions, negative affect, and task mastery. Design and methods: We conducted a three-wave longitudinal study among caregivers. Our final sample consisted of 241 caregivers from 53 different care homes. We tested our hypotheses via path analysis while estimating standard errors that are robust to non-independence of observations. Results: Analyses showed that cognitive crafting moderated the relationship between turnover intentions and negative affect: When caregivers cognitively crafted their job, turnover intentions were negatively related to negative affect. Conclusions: This study indicates that cognitive crafting can be considered a coping strategy during difficult times at work. If employees do not devalue but revalue their job despite having turnover intentions, they can keep negative affect at bay. Still, this study also illustrates the limits of cognitive crafting by showing that the relationship between turnover intentions and task mastery is not affected by reframing one’s work. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. cognitive crafting; intention to leave; Job crafting; negative affect; task mastery; turnover intention', 'The Power of Doing: How Job Crafting Transmits the Beneficial Impact of Autonomy Among Overqualified Employees Overqualified individuals have more experience, KSAs (knowledge, skills, abilities), and/or education than what is needed in their job. Prior research has identified autonomy as a work characteristic that helps individuals deal with overqualification; yet, it remains unclear as to why this is the case. The goal of the present study was to identify the mechanism through which autonomy exerts its beneficial impact. Drawing on the literatures of person-environment fit and proactivity, we first hypothesized that, in addition to autonomy, job crafting likewise moderates the relationship between overqualification and both withdrawal and turnover intention as central outcomes. Job crafting denotes a proactive type of behavior whereby individuals change the boundaries of their jobs. Next, we hypothesized that job crafting is positively related to autonomy, and that job crafting represents the key mechanism through which autonomy moderates the overqualification-outcome relationship. In a multisource sample of 226 employee-supervisor dyads, we found that overqualified employees were significantly more likely to withdraw from their work and intend to exit if (a) their job provided little autonomy or (b) if they engaged in low levels of job crafting. When individuals experienced high levels of autonomy or engaged in high levels of job crafting, the overqualification-outcome relationship was reversed (or non-significant). Moreover, autonomy was positively related to job crafting. Finally, we found evidence for mediated moderation, such that the moderating effect of autonomy on the relationship between overqualification and both withdrawal and turnover intention was transmitted through job crafting. We discuss theoretical and practical implications. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Autonomy; Job crafting; Job design; Overqualification']"

Voluntary turnover results in loss of expertise and institutional knowledge as well as high costs to recruit and train replacement workers. Objective: To analyze patterns and predictors of voluntary turnover among public health workers. Design: Descriptive analysis and linear probability regression models. Participants: Employees of state health agencies in the United States who participated in the Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS). Main Outcome Measures: Intended retirement and voluntary departure; pay satisfaction; job satisfaction. Results: Nearly 25% of workers reported plans to retire before 2020, and an additional 18% reported the intention to leave their current organization within 1 year. Four percent of staff are considering leaving their organization in the next year for a job at a different health department. There was significant heterogeneity by demographic, socioeconomic, and job characteristics. Areas such as administration/management, health education, health services, social services, and epidemiology may be particularly vulnerable to turnover. The strongest predictors of voluntary departure were pay and job satisfaction, which were associated with 9 (P < .001) and 24 (P < .001) percentage-point decreases, respectively, in the probability to report the intention to leave. Our findings suggest that if all workers were satisfied with their job and pay, intended departure would be 7.4%, or less than half the current 18% rate. Controlling for salary levels, higher levels of education and longer work experience were associated with lower pay satisfaction, except for physicians, who were 11 percentage points (P = .02) more likely to be satisfied with their pay than employees with doctoral degrees. Several workplace characteristics related to relationships with supervisors, workplace environment, and employee motivation/morale were significantly associated with job satisfaction. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that public health agencies may face significant pressure from worker retirement and voluntary departures in coming years. Although retirement can be addressed through recruitment efforts, addressing other voluntary departures will require focusing on improving pay and job satisfaction.

Design and setting. A survey of all NMT professional body members in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland was conducted. This paper reports on survey findings of those no longer working as a NMT. Analysis of 1996, 2001 and 2006 Australian Census data and Medicare statistics was made for NMTs, sonographers and radiographers. Main outcome measures. The five most influential reasons for leaving nuclear medicine were measured by survey. Census data measured workforce characteristics; size, sex, age. Medicare statistics measured national service provision. Results. Primarily, limited career pathways and professional plateau influence retention of NMTs, with sonography a common career move. Nuclear medicine technologists are young (44.3% <30 years) compared with radiography (52.3% <40 years) or sonography (52.8% <40 years). From 2001 to 2006, service provision in nuclear medicine grew by 11.8% compared with 36% in ultrasound but the workforce size decreased by 4.9% whereas sonographers increased by 51.1%. Conclusions. Increasing the level of job control is the most likely factor in creating a positive change to the NMT job characteristics and improving retention. What is known about the topic? The early and high level of attrition of NMTs with an overall decrease in workforce size from 2001 to 2006 and a corresponding increase in service provision has been reported by the authors of this paper. A comparison of age distribution patterns between NMTs, diagnostic radiographers and radiation therapists from the 1996 and 2001 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census showed NMTs to have a much younger workforce, indicating that workers do not remain long in the field. A direct career pathway to sonography exists for NMTs, with an indication that there is movement to this field. The levels of work engagement and job satisfaction in private and public NMTs have been reported, with factors influencing these levels identified. What does this paper add? This paper reports findings of a survey of NMTs who have left the workforce, providing insight into the most influential reasons for leaving and the type of position to which the individual moves. The NMT and sonography workforce age distribution patterns from the 2006 Census data are compared with those for diagnostic radiography to determine whether the previously reported NMT downward trend remains. A comparison of ultrasound, radiography and nuclear medicine service provision between 2001 and 2006 is made to explore factors that may affect changes to workforce size. This paper builds on findings of the NMT's levels of work engagement and satisfaction to more fully understand why such high levels of attrition occur. What are the implications for practitioners? This paper highlights the need for a change of structure to the NMT job in order to keep more experienced workers in the field. The NMT attrition, in conjunction with the anticipated national population trends with an increasing elderly population, places the quality of nuclear medicine services at risk. The present rapid turnover leads to a workforce in which the majority are young with limited experience. © 2011 AHHA. "", ""Support needs of veterinary surgeons during the first few years of practice: Perceptions of recent graduates and senior partners Postal surveys or personal interviews of 76 recent veterinary graduates and their 49 employers were undertaken to establish their perceptions of good practice when integrating a new graduate into a business and their preferred methods of assessment and development. Practice type and location were the main influences on graduates looking for their first job. Interviews were mostly informal. Employers expected basic veterinary competence and candidates expected good quality support. Most graduates (93 per cent) had their own consultations on the first day. During early consultations 2 per cent of senior vets accompanied the new graduate, 95 per cent of practices provided senior back-up either in person or by telephone but in 3 per cent no back-up was available. Most new graduates (90 per cent) were satisfied with their workload. Three-fifths were on-call within the first week, and 95 per cent within a month. Graduates received calls directly in 45 per cent of practices, in 9 per cent seniors screened the calls, and the remainder used a third party. Assistance from experienced lay staff varied greatly. Discussion of problems was mainly informal. There was little spontaneous feedback and problems resulted from inadequate communication. One in three new graduates left their first job within two years, and one in six identified lack of support, heavy workload, stress or clashes with staff as a primary reason. This high turnover was a problem for employers. From the new graduates' perspectives, initial problems included: being on call (59 per cent), financial aspects (47 per cent) and surgery (43 per cent). Communicating with clients and learning to prioritise jobs were also difficult. New graduates took longer over procedures (79 per cent of employers commented) and required extra back-up (91 per cent) both of which reduced income (59 per cent). Nearly all the seniors felt their current new graduates had coped 'quite well', although it was claimed that new graduates lacked the ability to talk to clients at the appropriate level, wanted to bring all their scientific knowledge to bear on every case, and often failed to consider the obvious or to appreciate clients' needs. Only 18 per cent of practices had formal and regular review procedures but all monitored the response of clients and watched the new graduate perform. Feedback to their new colleague was considered 'adequate' by 85 per cent of seniors, although 45 per cent of graduates felt they had not received enough. Eighty-three per cent of new graduates felt 'moderately prepared' by their undergraduate course, and 76 per cent of senior vets were 'generally satisfied'. Both wanted improvements in extramural studies and increased exposure to routine cases. Senior partners sought greater commitment in the undergraduate curriculum to financial/legal issues and communication skills. Over a third of employers (38 per cent) had a 'great influence' on the choice of continuing professional development courses for their recent graduates. New graduates chose courses to deal with a perceived weakness, or to specialise, and welcomed opportunities to meet other new graduates and share early experiences. It was concluded that turnover and staff problems would be reduced if practices became more effective in coping with new arrivals, especially by supporting their development. ""]"

How meaningfulness in life moderates the mediated effects of role stressors’ appraisals on anxiety and intention to leave the State Brazilian Police Brazilian police officers’ increasing levels of work anxiety and intention to leave the job are consistent with other police forces around the world. Among the important variables that appear to be antecedents of these unwanted organizational outcomes are increasing role stressors associated with police work. We conjecture that how police officers appraise stressors would affect whether adverse outcomes prevail. Specifically, stressors appraised as challenges result in weaker adverse outcomes compared with stressors appraised as hindrances. We also anticipate that a boundary condition that might further attenuate adverse outcomes is having meaningfulness in life (MIL). Likewise, having low MIL can intensify the potential adverse outcomes of stressors appraised as hindrances. This study aims to investigate how role stressors appraised as either challenges or hindrances may influence anxiety and intention to leave among state police officers in the Brazilian Federal District (DF), as well as implications of MIL as a moderator variable of these relationships. Our hypotheses supported the mediating effect of role stressors’ appraisals in their prediction of police officers’ anxiety and intention to leave their job, and the moderator effects of MIL in these same relationships. Findings are discussed in terms of changes in police regulations and training programs aimed at increasing officers’ MIL and coping strategies to redirect how they appraise role stressors as challenges rather than as hindrances, which may lead to a healthier work experience for DF State Police officers. © The Author(s) 2022.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether management supports police officers adequately, or whether police have to rely on their individual attributes, specifically psychological capital (PsyCap), to cope with red tape and stress. Work outcomes/consequences examined were discretionary power, affective commitment and turnover intentions. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional design using a survey-based, self-report strategy was used to collect data from 588 police officers from USA, who are most engaged with the public. The data were analysed using AMOS and a structural model to undertake structural equation modelling. Findings: Two significant paths were identified Path 1: management support to red tape to discretionary power to affective commitment and turnover intentions; and Path 2: supervisor relationships to PsyCap to stress to affective commitment and turnover intentions. Further, management support predicted PsyCap, red tape and police stressors. Red tape increased police stressors and turnover intentions. Research limitations/implications: The use of self-report surveys is a limitation, causing common methods bias. Using Harmon’s one-factor post hoc test, the authors were able to provide some assurance that common method bias was of no major concern. Originality/value: As far as is known, this study is the first to examine, for police officers, how PsyCap impacts upon negative factors (stress and red tape) and enhances positive drivers for employees. Examining the impact of an individual attribute – PsyCap – provides an important piece of the organizational puzzle in explaining the commitment and turnover intentions of police officers. By examining the impact of both organizational and individual factors, there is now more knowledge about the antecedents of police outcomes. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study is based on a survey of 908 managers and employees from 43 companies in different regions of China. The results of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) show that organizational learning in Chinese enterprises is a multi-dimensional construct comprising of inter-organizational learning, organization-level learning, collective learning, individual learning, exploitation learning and exploration learning. The results of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) reveal that the unit-level dimensions of organizational learning affect employee's satisfaction and emotional commitment through the mediation of individual learning. In organizations characterized by high level of organization-level learning and low level of exploitation learning, there is a strong correlation between employees' satisfaction/emotional commitment and their turnover intention.

This study set up and examined the overarching model on resistance to change. Moreover, there were two models theoretically presented and investigated, i.e. direct and indirect models. This study was an attempt to explore and capture the causes of organizational cynicism against the change initiative. Design/methodology/approach – A case study research design was used in this study, and data were collected from 335 employees by using purposive sampling technique and structured questionnaire. While linear regression and Baron and Kenny’s (1986) tests were used to evaluate the direct and indirect models. Findings – Results highlighted the considerable positive relationship between dispositional resistance and employee’s turnover intention. Additionally, significant connection was also examined among organizational contextual factors and job outcomes, whereas interactive impact of behavioral resistance was found in the relation among dispositional resistance, organizational contextual factors and employee’s intent to quit. However, another dimension of organizational cynicism, i.e. cognitive resistance, could not influence the direct linear relationship between organizational context and continuance commitment. Research limitations/implications – Major limitations of this research were non-probability sampling technique, cross-sectional design, single organization and traditional data collection tool. Practical implications – Management can eradicate cynicism by providing social support and positive information, i.e. job security, wage award, medical benefits and promotion criteria, after implementing change. The management can clarify the objectives of that change by including employees in decision-making, reducing employee’s turnover intention. Organizational cynicism is a faith, which means that the change leaders have lack of integrity; when organizational cynicism mixes with negative cognitive process, it leads to a more destructive behavior against that change.

The purpose of this study was to empirically demonstrate that organizational change frequency predicts change fatigue, and that change fatigue predicts important outcomes (e.g. reduced performance) via mediators such as reduced commitment and satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: In two cross-sectional studies, the authors explored predictors, mediators and outcomes of change fatigue. Findings: In study one, participants from organizations experiencing more change reported greater change fatigue, and change fatigue predicted increased strain, burnout, intention to turnover and decreased engagement. In study two, change fatigue had significant indirect effects on teamwork, turnover intention and performance via reduced job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Research limitations/implications: Both studies were cross-sectional; future studies should explore the predictors and consequences of change fatigue longitudinally.

It extends prior research which examined these linkages (Chong & Monroe, 2015; Fogarty, Singh, Rhoads, & Moore, 2000; Smith, Davy, & Everly, 2007) by evaluating a model that simultaneously incorporates stress arousal and the three fundamental dimensions of burnout, i.e., emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. This paper also utilizes a recently validated stress arousal measure designed to capture the worry and rumination aspects of arousal posited to be responsible for a number of negative personal outcomes. The results indicate that role stressors, mediated by stress arousal and the individual burnout dimensions, have a negative influence on job outcomes. In line with predictions regarding the temporal ordering of stress arousal and burnout in the model, each of the job stressors had a significant positive influence on accountants' stress arousal, and the influence of the individual role stressors on each burnout dimension was either partially or fully mediated via their relations with stress arousal. In turn, the influence of stress arousal on each of the job outcomes was either partially or fully mediated through its relations with emotional exhaustion.

We aimed at determining the most common job characteristics and their stressfulness; relationships between stress exposure, health and occupational functioning; differences between radio journalists and other journalists, and also the psychosocial risk for health and functioning in this group. Material and Methods: The studied group involved 208 journalists, 134 of whom worked in radio stations. The respondents flled in the Psychosocial Risks Scale (PRS) developed by the Department of Health and Work Psychology of the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Łódź, Poland. Results: Requirement of mental effort and readiness to response quickly for most of the time as well as limited possibilities for promotion were the most frequent journalists' complaints. We confrmed that higher levels of stress resulted in worse functioning - the radio journalists who experienced lower stress assessed their health status and ability to work better, were more satisfed with particular aspects of their work, and were more involved in their work. They also presented a significantly lower turnover intention. Moreover, the radio journalists were more involved in their work than other journalists, but experienced lower satisfaction, took more sick leaves and had more days of absence. Conclusions: Well-known relationships between stress level, satisfaction and occupational functioning were confrmed. The most important conclusion refers to the fact that psychosocial risks and stress analysis should be based on the understanding of specificity of each occupation or even position. It is so, because the same job characteristic may pose a challenge for one person, while for another - it can result in extreme discomfort and anxiety - such an attitude broadens understanding of the phenomenon. We also confrmed that the PRS is a well-designed method, appropriate to investigate an individual perception of job environment and its stressfulness. Future research on causal relationships between the variables is recommended.
